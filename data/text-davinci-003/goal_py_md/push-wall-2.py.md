# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper near the puck, to the side of the wall
    #  2. Push the puck against the wall
    #  3. Slide the puck around the wall to the target location
    # First, we need to make sure the gripper is to the side of the wall, not on
    # top of it or in front of it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the side of the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck")
    # Now that the gripper is to the side of the wall, we can push the puck
    # against it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("onto the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the puck is now against the wall, we can slide the puck around the wall
    # to the target location.
    if check("the puck is pressed against the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the wall")
    # Once the robot is above the target location, drop the puck.
    if check("the robot is above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location", close_gripper=False)
