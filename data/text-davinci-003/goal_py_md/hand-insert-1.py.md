Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the puck
3. Close the gripper around the puck
4. Move the puck to the goal

If the robot's gripper is not already above the puck, move it there. We don't need to worry about the orientation of the gripper, so this should be a relatively straightforward move.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper isn't around the puck, move it around the puck so that the gripper has a hold of the puck. We don't need to worry too much about the orientation of the gripper here either - the aim is to get it in the vicinity of the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the end of the gripper is in the vicinity of the puck, close the gripper so that it can securely hold the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

Finally, move the puck and the gripper to the goal, making sure that the gripper does not lose its grip on the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
