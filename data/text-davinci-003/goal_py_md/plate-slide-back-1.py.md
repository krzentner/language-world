The steps for this task are: 
1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Place gripper sideways above the plate
3. Push down on the plate from the side to trap it
4. Move the plate back in to its target location

Once completed, your program should look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Place gripper sideways above plate
    #  3. Push down on plate from the side to trap it
    #  4. Move plate back in to its target location
    # The first step is to put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # Now, place the gripper sideways above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not sideways aligned from the plate"):    
        robot.move_gripper("sideways aligned from the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # Now push down on the plate from the side, to trap it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is sideways aligned from the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate")
    # Finally, move the plate back in to its target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is trapped by the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
