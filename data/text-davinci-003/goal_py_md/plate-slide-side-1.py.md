The steps to slide the plate sideways would be:

1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Move gripper so it's slightly left of the plate
3. Push plate right until it is horizontally aligned with the target location
4. Move plate until it is fully inside the target location

The code could look like this:

```
# plate-slide-side: slide the plate sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Move gripper so it's slightly left of the plate
    #  3. Push plate right until it is horizontally aligned with the target location
    #  4. Move plate until it is fully inside the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
    # Now move the gripper slightly left of the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not slightly left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("slightly left of the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # Push the plate right until it is almost horizontally aligned with the
    # target location.
    if check("plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not far right of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("far right of the plate")
    # Finally, move the plate fully into the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
```
