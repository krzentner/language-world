Here's the program:

```
# plate-slide-side: slide the plate sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate 
    #  2. Line up the plate and gripper 
    #  3. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # Then, line up the gripper and plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the plate")
    # Finally, slide the plate sideways into the target location. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the target location")
```
