Here's the program written out:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    #  5. Push puck against wall
    #  6. Move puck to target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the wall")
    # Press the puck against the wall. The gripper should move up and down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of wall and the puck is not pressed against the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    
    # Move the puck to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of wall and the puck is pressed against the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
