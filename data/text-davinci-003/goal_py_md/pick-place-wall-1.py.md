Then, the program should continue as follows:

```
# Steps:
#  1. Put gripper above puck (on the same side of the wall as the puck)
#  2. Drop gripper around puck
#  3. Close gripper around puck
#  4. Move puck over the wall in alignment with target
#  5. Move puck to target location
# First, determine which side of the wall the puck is on, then move the gripper above the puck and onto the same side of the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above a puck"):
        # First determine which side of the wall is the puck 
        if check("the puck is to the left of the wall"):

        else: 
            robot.move_gripper("above the puck and to the right of the wall")

# If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
   
# If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")

# Move the puck over the wall and align it with the target.
    if check("puck is above the wall and puck is not horizontally aligned with target"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with target")

# Finally, move the puck to the target location.
    if check("puck is horizontally aligned with target"):
