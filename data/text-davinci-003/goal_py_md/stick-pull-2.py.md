Next, the robot needs to put the gripper above the stick. If the gripper is not already above the stick, move it above the stick:
```
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the stick")
```

After the gripper is lined up above the stick, it needs to go around the stick and grip it:
```
    # If the gripper is not around the stick, go around and grip it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the stick", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper has the stick, the robot needs to align the stick with the thermos so that the stick can be used to pull the thermos.
```
    # Once the gripper has the stick, line up the stick with the thermos.
    if check("the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the thermos")
```

Finally, the robot needs to use the stick to pull the the thermos to the target location:
```
    # If the stick is lined up with the thermos, use the stick to pull it to the target location.
    if check("the stick is horizontally aligned with the thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
```

And the full program is:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the stick")
    # If the gripper is not around the stick, go around and grip it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the stick", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper has the stick, line up the stick with the thermos.
    if check("the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the thermos")
    # If the stick is lined up with the thermos, use the stick to pull it to the target location.
    if check
