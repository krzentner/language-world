Next, using the code from other tasks as reference, we'll define the steps the robot needs to do:

1. Put gripper above plate
2. Hook gripper around plate
3. Move plate back and to the side

The code for this tasks would look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Hook gripper around plate
    #  3. Move plate back and to the side
    # Put the gripper roughly above the plate so that we don't bump it while
    # grabbing it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the plate isn't back and to the side, move it back and to the side.
    if check("the plate is not back and to the side of the target"):
        robot.move_gripper("back and to the side of the target")
```
