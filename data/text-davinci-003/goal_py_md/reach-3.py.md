# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper to target location
    # First, move the robot's gripper to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
    # Once the gripper is roughly above the target location, move it precisely 
    # to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("exactly above the target location")
