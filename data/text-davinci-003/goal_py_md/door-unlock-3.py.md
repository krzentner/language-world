def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper with the door lock 
    #  2. Turn the dial on the lock to the correct setting
    # First, line up the gripper with the door lock.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the door lock")
    # Now we can turn the dial by moving the gripper left and right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("left and right", to="unlock position")
