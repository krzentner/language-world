The steps involved in the program are:
1. Place the gripper in front of the handle 
2. Pull the handle up

The code should look like this:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of the handle
    #  2. Pull the handle up
    # First, put the gripper in front of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up, we can pull the handle up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("up")
```
