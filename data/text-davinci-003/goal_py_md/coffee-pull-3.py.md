The program should be able to:

1. Put the gripper above the mug
2. Grab the mug with the gripper
3. Pull the mug to the target location

Solution:
```
# coffee-pull: grab the mug and pull it to the target location
def coffee_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the mug
    #  2. Grab the mug with the gripper
    #  3. Pull the mug to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the mug")
    # If the mug is left of the robot's gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the mug. 
    # Because the mug is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("mug is not left of the robot's gripper and mug is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the mug", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is close to the mug, grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the mug and the gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the mug", close_gripper=True)
    # Move the mug to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
