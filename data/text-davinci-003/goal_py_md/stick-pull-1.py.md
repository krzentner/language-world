The following algorithm describes how the robot could accomplish this task:

1. Put the gripper above the stick.
2. Grab the stick with the gripper.
3. Line the stick up with the thermos.
4. Pull the thermos with the stick to the target location. 

To accomplish this, code would look like this:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Grab stick with gripper
    #  3. Line stick up with thermos
    #  4. Pull thermos with stick to target location
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the stick")
    # If the gripper isn't near the stick yet, move it near the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the stick", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the stick, we can attempt to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the thermos")
    # If the stick is lined up with the thermos, pull them both to the target location.
    if check("the stick is horizontally aligned with the thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
