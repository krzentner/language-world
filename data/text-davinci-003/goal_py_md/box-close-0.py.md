Then we can add the steps needed to complete the box-close task:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lid
    #  2. Pick up lid
    #  3. Move lid to box
    #  4. Place lid on box
    # First, put the gripper above the lid of the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lid")
    # Once the gripper is above the lid, we can close the gripper to pick up the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lid", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is closed around the lid, we can move the lid to the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lid and the lid is not near the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box")
    # If the lid is near the box, open the gripper to place the lid on top of the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lid and the lid is near the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box", close_gripper=False)
