The program should be written as follows:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wall
    #  2. Move the gripper to the side of the wall to go around it
    #  3. Reach the final target location
    # First, put the gripper above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    # If the gripper isn't lined up next to the wall, move it to the side of the 
    # wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the side of the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("to the side of the wall")
    # If the gripper is lined up next to the wall, move it to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the side of the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the goal")
```
