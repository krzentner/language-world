The robot should grab the dial and turn it clockwise. Here's an example program:

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
def dial_turn(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Grab the dial with the gripper
    #  3. Turn the dial clockwise
    # First, put the gripper slightly above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the dial")
    # If the gripper isn't near the dial, grab it with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with dial and  the robot's gripper is not near dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the dial and closed, we can turn it clockwise.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("clockwise")
```
