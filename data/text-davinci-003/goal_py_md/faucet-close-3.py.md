The program should be as follows:

```
# faucet-close: turn the faucet right
def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near faucet mechanism
    #  2. Push to the right to close the faucet
    # First, move the gripper to the faucet mechanism. 
    # We don't need to align it, as long as it's near. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the faucet mechanism"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the faucet mechanism")
    # Now that the gripper is near the faucet, use it to push the faucet mechanism to the right. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet mechanism"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the faucet mechanism")
```
