Here's the solution:
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
def sweep(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube to target location
    # First, put the gripper above cube in order to grab it without bumping into it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the cube", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the cube, close it to trap and pick up the cube. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with target location")
    # Once the cube is aligned, slide it to the target location. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
