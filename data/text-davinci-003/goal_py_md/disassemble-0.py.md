Then, write code:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    #  3. Pull screwdriver off peg
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
    # If the wrench is still on the peg, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    # Again, line up the gripper from the front rather than around the wrench
    # so as to avoid bumps.
    if check("wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the robot's grip is locked on the wrench, slowly pull the wrench off
    # the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the wrench is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the peg")
