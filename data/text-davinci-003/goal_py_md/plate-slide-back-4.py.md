The goal of this task is to slide a plate back into a target location.

Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the plate
  2. Slide the plate to the left

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move it so that it is.

```    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
```

Once the gripper is above the plate, move it slightly to the left, which should slide the plate back into the target location.

```    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("slightly to the left")
```
