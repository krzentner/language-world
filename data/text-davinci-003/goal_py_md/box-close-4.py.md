# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the box lid
    #  2. Drop gripper around box lid
    #  3. Close gripper around box lid
    #  4. Place lid onto box
    # First, put the gripper above the box lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box lid")
    # If the gripper isn't around the box lid, move it around the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the box lid", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the box lid and open, close the gripper to pick up the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("close to the box")
    # Once the gripper has the box lid, move it to the box to place the lid.
    # Make sure to open the gripper first so we don't drop the lid on the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box", open_gripper=True)
