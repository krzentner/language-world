    # Then, put the gripper around the door lock.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door lock")
    # Finally, turn the dial to the side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("clockwise around the door lock", close_gripper=True)
