The program should read as follows:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach gripper over the wall
    #  2. Reach gripper towards the target
    # First, reach the gripper over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    # Once the gripper is above the wall, reach it towards the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target and the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
```
