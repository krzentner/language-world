Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Push the gripper into the top of the puck
3. Slide the puck to the goal behind the robot

If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper above the puck:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper is above the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the gripper, move the gripper back behind the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move_gripper("behind the target location")
```
