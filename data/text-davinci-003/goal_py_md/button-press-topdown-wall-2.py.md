The steps would be:
1. Put gripper near the top of the short wall
2. Drop gripper across the top of the short wall
3. Push down on the short wall
4. Move the gripper left of the button
5. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
6. Push down on the button from the top

Example code:
```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the top of the short wall
    #  2. Drop gripper across the top of the short wall
    #  3. Push down on the short wall
    #  4. Move the gripper left of the button
    #  5. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  6. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper at the top of the short wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the top of the short wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the top of the short wall")
    # If the gripper is not across the top of the wall, move it across the top
    # of the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not across the top of the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("across the top of the wall")
    # With the gripper across the top of the wall, we can push down on the wall
    # to move it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is across the top of the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the short wall")
    # Move the gripper left of the button.
    if check("button is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button")
    # Line up the gripper with the button as viewed from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
