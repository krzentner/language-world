The steps of the task are as follows:

1. Put gripper above the wall
2. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
3. Push down on the button from the top above the wall

The code would look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wall
    #  2. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  3. Push down on the button from the top above the wall
    # First, put the gripper above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    # Once the gripper is above the wall, line it up as viewed from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
