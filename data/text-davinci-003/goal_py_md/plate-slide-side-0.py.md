        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
3. Line the plate up with the target location
    if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with target location")
4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
