Steps:
1. Line up the gripper with the button as viewed from above.
2. Push down on the button with the gripper.

If the robot's gripper is not lined up with the button, then the gripper should be moved to be vertically aligned with it:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is lined up, the button can be pressed by pushing down on it with the gripper:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
