Here's the code:
```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from slightly above the wall
    #  2. Push down from the top
    # First, line up the gripper from slightly above the wall so that the gripper
    # is lined up with the button from the top.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the button from slightly above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the button from slightly above the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with button from slightly above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
