We need to solve this problem by pushing the button from above with a short wall in the way.

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above short wall and aligned with the button
2. Move the gripper forward and downward to align it with the button 
3. Push down against the top of the button

If the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the gripper to be above the wall and aligned with the button. 
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the wall and aligned with the button")
```

Once the gripper is above the wall and aligned with the button, we need to move the gripper forward and downward to align it with the button, so we can push down against the top of the button.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and not aligned with the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("forward and downward aligned with the button")
```

Once the gripper is aligned with the button, we can push down against the top of the button:
```
if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```

The complete code should look like this: 

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above short wall and aligned with the button
    #  2. Move the gripper forward and downward to align it with the button
    #  3. Push down against the top of the button

    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall and aligned with the button")

    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and not aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward and downward aligned with the button")

    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
