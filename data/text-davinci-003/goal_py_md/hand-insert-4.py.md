    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.

    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.

        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
