    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the robot's gripper is in front of the plate, push the plate back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the plate")
```
