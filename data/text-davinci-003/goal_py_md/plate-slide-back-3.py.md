The steps to perform the task are:

1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Push gripper into the top of the plate
3. Slide the plate back into the target location

So the desired program would be:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Push gripper into the top of the plate
    #  3. Slide the plate back into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate so we can push it back into place.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the plate is below the gripper, close the gripper around the plate
    # to trap it
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertical aligned with the plate and the robot's Gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # Finally, slide the plate back into the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```
