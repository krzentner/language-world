The steps for this task would be:
1. Put gripper above the puck
2. Drop gripper around the puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Insert puck into the target location 

The code for this task would be:

```
# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
# def hand_insert(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Insert puck into the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Now, once the gripper is near the target, we can insert the puck into the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("into the target location")
