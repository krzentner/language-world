The code for the task should look like this:

```
# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
def hand_insert(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the puck and open, close the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Move the puck to the target location.
    # Since the puck is now controlled by the robot, we don't need to be
    # careful about the direction we move it in.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
