    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the plate
    #  3. Push the plate back, sideways
    #  4. Slide the plate back into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.

    # As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate, push it back by
    # moving the gripper slightly left of the plate.
