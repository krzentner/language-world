Assuming that the robot's gripper is open and the plate is currently in front of the gripper, the program should look something like this:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper with the plate 
    #  2. Push the plate horizontally to the target location
    # First, line up the gripper with the plate so that it is almost vertically 
    # aligned with the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper has a grip on the plate, we can slide it towards the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the target location")
```
