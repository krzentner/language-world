    # Steps:

    #  2. Push the puck to the target location
    # First, put the gripper slightly in front of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is slightly in front of the puck, we can push it to
    # the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
