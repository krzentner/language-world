Next, set the steps so the robot can rotate the lever up:

1. Put the gripper above the lever.
2. Grab the lever with the gripper.
3. Rotate the lever up.

Then, implement the code:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the lever
    #  2. Grab the lever with the gripper
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # Put the gripper above the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lever")
    # Once the gripper is above the lever, grab it by moving the gripper down
    # around the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the lever", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the lever, rotate it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("upward relative to the lever")
```
