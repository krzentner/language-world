The code for the dial-turn task is as follows: 

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
def dial_turn(robot):
    # Steps: 
    #  1. Put gripper above dial
    #  2. Grab the dial using the gripper from the side
    #  3. Rotate the dial 
    # First, put the gripper above the dial. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the dial")
    # If the dial is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the dial.
    # Because the dial is a small object, check if the gripper is lined up 
    # with it from the side instead of above it. 
    if check("dial is not left of the robot's gripper and dial is not side aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("side aligned with the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the dial, rotate the dial. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is side aligned with dial and dial is not rotated"):
        robot.move_gripper("rotate the dial")
