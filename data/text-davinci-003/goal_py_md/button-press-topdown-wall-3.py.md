Steps:
1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above with the wall
2. Push the wall away using the gripper
3. Move the gripper around the wall to button
4. Push down on the button

If the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move it so it is:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
```

Then push the wall away from the button using the gripper:

```
if check("the wall is above the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the button")
```

Next, move the gripper around the wall so it is facing the button:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the button")
```

Finally, push down on the button:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
