After that, the code should look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Slide the plate back
    # First, put the gripper above the plate, so that the robot can grip it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # Once the gripper is above the plate, slide it back by moving the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
