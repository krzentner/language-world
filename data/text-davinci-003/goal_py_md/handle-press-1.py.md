```
# handle-press: push down the handle
def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Push down the handle
    # We need to line up the gripper with the handle before we can push it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the handle")
    # If the gripper is lined up with the handle, we can close the gripper and
    # push down the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle", close_gripper=True)
