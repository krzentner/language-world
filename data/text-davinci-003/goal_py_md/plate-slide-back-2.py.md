Then, add the following code:
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper on the side of the plate
    #  2. Slide the plate back
    # First, put the gripper to the side of the plate, so that it can grip the
    # plate as it slides it back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not next to the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("next to the plate")
    # Once the gripper is next to the plate, the robot can slide it back by 
    # pushing the plate with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is next to the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("behind the plate")
