```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push plate back into target location
    #  3. Push harder to fully slide the plate back
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # Once the gripper is above the plate, try to slide the plate back by pushing
    # it from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not in the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # If the plate is still not fully in the target location, push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the plate is not in the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
