The code would then look like this:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near puck
    #  2. Push against the puck to move it
    #  3. Increase pressure until the puck moves
    # First, put the gripper near the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck")
    # Now we can start pushing against the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the puck")
    # If the puck is still not moving, we need to increase the pressure by pushing
    # harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the puck")
    # If the puck is in front of the target, give it a final push.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the puck is in front of the target"):
        robot.move_gripper("close to the target location")
```
