Then, the code to perform the desired task would look like this:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate from above
    #  2. Drop gripper down to around plate
    #  3. Slide plate to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate from above.
    if check("gripper is not above plate from above"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate from above")
    # If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the plate, slide it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the target location")
```
