# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near wall
    #  2. Push gripper into wall
    #  3. Move gripper to button
    # First, the robot needs to put its gripper close to the wall so it can
    # push against it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
    # If the gripper is near the wall but not pushing on it, try to push on the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near wall and the robot's gripper is not pushing against wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("into the wall")
    # If the gripper is pushing against the wall and the button is still out of reach,
    # move the gripper to the button so the Robot can push it down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is pushing against the wall and the button is not in reach of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
    # If the button is in reach of the robot's gripper, push the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button"):
