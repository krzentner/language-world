The robot should be able to accomplish this task by following these steps:

1. Put the gripper around the wrench handle
2. Pull the wrench off the peg

First, put the gripper around the wrench handle.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the wrench handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the wrench handle")
```

Once the gripper is around the wrench handle, we can start pulling it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
```
