Then, the code should be as follows:

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the door handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the door
    #  3. Push the door closed harder
    # First, put the gripper left of the door handle.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the door handle")
    # If the gripper is near the door handle, we can probably slide the door
    # close now by pushing it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the door handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle, push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the door handle")
     # If the robot's gripper is aligned with the door handle, we can start pushing the door closer
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target position")
```
