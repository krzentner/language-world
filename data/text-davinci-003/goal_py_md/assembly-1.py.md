Then add the following code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench
    #  2. Drop gripper around wrench
    #  3. Close gripper around wrench
    #  4. Put gripper above peg
    #  5. Rotate wrench around peg
    # First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wrench")
    # If the gripper isn't around the wrench, put it around the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the wrench, move the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # When the gripper is above the peg, we can rotate the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("rotate the wrench around the peg")
