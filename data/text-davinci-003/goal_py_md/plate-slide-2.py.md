Steps:
 1. Put the gripper above the plate
 2. Slide the plate to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the gripper above the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
```

If the gripper is above the plate, close the gripper to get a better grip on the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate", close_gripper=True)
```

Finally, if the plate has been gripped, move the plate to the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```
