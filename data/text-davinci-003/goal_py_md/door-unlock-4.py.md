Here's the solution:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above or near door handle
    #  2. Line up gripper with door handle
    #  3. Twist the handle to the unlock position
    # First, put the gripper above the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above or near door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above or near door handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the door handle, line it up with the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the door handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Finally, if the gripper is lined up with the door handle, twist the 
    # handle to unlock the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("twist to unlock position")
```
