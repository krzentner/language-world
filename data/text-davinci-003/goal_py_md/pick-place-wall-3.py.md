Below, we will write a program that controls the robot to perform the `pick-place-wall` task. First, we will put the gripper above the puck, but slightly over the wall that is in the way:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck, slightly over the wall
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper slightly above and over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("about 2 inches above the wall and the puck")
```

Next, we will drop the gripper around the puck:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck, slightly over the wall
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper slightly above and over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("about 2 inches above the wall and the puck")
    # Then, drop the gripper around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

After that, we will close the gripper around the puck:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck, slightly over the wall
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper slightly above and over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("about 2 inches above the wall and the puck")
    # Then, drop the gripper around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # Finally, close the gripper around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck but not closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the puck", close_gripper=True
