The following steps outline how the robot can push the button on the coffee machine.

1. Locate and line up the gripper directly above the coffee button. 
2. Close the gripper and push down slightly onto the button.
3. Push the button all the way down.

The code to perform the task would look like this:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
def coffee_button(robot):
    # Step 1: Locate and line up the gripper directly above the coffee button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button")
    # Step 2: Close the gripper and push down slightly onto the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Step 3: Push the button all the way down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button")
```
