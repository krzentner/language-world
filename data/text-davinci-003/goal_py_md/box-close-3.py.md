Your code should be along these lines:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above box lid
    #  2. Close gripper around the box lid
    #  3. Place the box lid on the box
    # First, put the gripper above the box lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lid")
    # If the gripper isn't around the lid, put it around the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is open and not around the lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the lid", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the lid and closed, maybe we can pick it up by
    # moving the gripper near the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lid and is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the box")
    # When the gripper is near the box, we can place the lid on the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box")
