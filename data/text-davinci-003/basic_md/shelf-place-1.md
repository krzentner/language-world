The robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, the robot should put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block and the robot's gripper is not near the block, the robot should put the gripper around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block. 
    - When the block is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the block at goal.
