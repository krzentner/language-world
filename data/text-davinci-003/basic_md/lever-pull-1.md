To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is not around lever, the robot should catch lever with gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, the robot should rotate lever up.
