The robot should perform the following steps to pull the peg out from the side reliably: 
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
   - When the peg is too close to pull, the robot should grab the peg lower than its center. 
   - When the peg is far enough away, the robot should lift the peg up until the peg is at the same height of the board. 
   - When the robot's gripper is close enough to the board, the robot should pull the peg away from the board.
