The steps that the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably are:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle, the robot should move gripper above window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the robot's gripper around the window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the window handle, the robot should push window closed to the right.
