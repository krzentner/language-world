The robot should perform the following steps to push the soccer ball into the target location reliably:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, the robot should move gripper below the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball, the robot should start pushing the soccer ball towards the goal.
    - When the soccer ball is close to the goal, the robot should adjust the pushing angle of the robot's gripper by moving it away from the goal to increase the pushing force.
