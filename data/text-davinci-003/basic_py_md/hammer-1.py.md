Here's the code to do the hammer task: 
```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the nail"):
        robot.place("gripper above the nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the nail"):
        robot.rotate("gripper to horizontally align with the nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is not close to the nail"):
        robot.approach("gripper closer to nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the nail and the gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper on hammer")
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the hammer"):
        robot.hit("nail with hammer")
```
