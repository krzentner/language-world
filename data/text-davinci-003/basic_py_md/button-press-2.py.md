```
# button-press: push the button from the front
# def button_press(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not above button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button"):
        robot.push("button")
```
