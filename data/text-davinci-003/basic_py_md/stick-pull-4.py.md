Here is the program for the stick-pull task:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("stick is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around stick and the thermos is not in front of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.push("stick to thermos")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around stick and the thermos is in front of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("stick toward the goal")
```
