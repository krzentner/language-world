The code should be:
```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
def dial_turn(robot):
	if check("the robot's gripper is not near the dial"):
		robot.reach("gripper to dial")
	if check("the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
		robot.close("gripper around dial")
	if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
		robot.turn("dial")
```
