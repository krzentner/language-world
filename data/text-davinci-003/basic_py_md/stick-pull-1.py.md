The program should read as follows: 
```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("stick towards thermos")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the thermos"):
        robot.pull("stick away from thermos")
```
