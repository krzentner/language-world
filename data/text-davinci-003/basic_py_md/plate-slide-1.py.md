The robot will first check if the plate is not positioned in front of it. If it’s not, it should be repositioned in front of the robot and then aligned with the target location:

```
  # plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
def plate_slide(robot):
    if check("the plate is not positioned in front of the robot"):
        robot.put("plate in front of robot")
    if check("the plate is in front of the robot and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.align("plate to target location")
```

Next, the robot will check if the plate is far enough away from the target location and then push it towards the target location:

```
  # plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
def plate_slide(robot):
    if check("the plate is not positioned in front of the robot"):
        robot.put("plate in front of robot")
    if check("the plate is in front of the robot and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.align("plate to target location")
    if check("the plate is far from the target location"):
        robot.push("plate towards target location")
```

Finally, the robot will check if the plate is not close enough to the target location. If it’s not, it should be moved closer: 

```
  # plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
def plate_slide(robot):
    if check("the plate is not positioned in front of the robot"):
        robot.put("plate in front of robot")
    if check("the plate is in front of the robot and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.align("plate to target location")
    if check("the plate is far from the target location"):
        robot.push("plate towards target location")
    if check("the plate is not close enough to the target location"):
        robot.move("plate closer to target location")
```
