The code should look like this:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper near peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.pull("peg out of hole")
    if check("the peg is out of the hole and the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move("gripper over target location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.place("peg at target location")
```
