Inside the function, the program should:

1. Align the robot's gripper with the wrench 
2. Grab the wrench with the gripper 
3. Align the wrench with the peg 
4. Wrap the wrench around the peg 

Here's the complete program:
```
# assembly: grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg
def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward-aligned with the peg and the wrench is not near the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench with peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.wrap("wrench around peg")
