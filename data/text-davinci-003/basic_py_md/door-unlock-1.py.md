Below is the code for the door unlocking task:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the door handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door handle and the robot's gripper is not pointing at the dial"):
        robot.move("gripper to face the dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is pointing at the dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is pointing at the dial and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.rotate("dial to unlock door")
```
