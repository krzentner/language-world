```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
def door_unlock(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not over the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper over the dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is over dial"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise")
    if check("dial has clicked at least once"):
        robot.pull("door open")
```
