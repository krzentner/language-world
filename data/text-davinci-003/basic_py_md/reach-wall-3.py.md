The program should be as follows:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.reach("to the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the wall is between the robot and the goal"):
        robot.reach("over the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal"):
        robot.reach("to the goal")
```
