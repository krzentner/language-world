Solution:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.place("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not near target"):
        robot.slide("plate to target")
    if check("the gripper is around the plate and the plate is near target"):
        robot.release("plate at target")
```
