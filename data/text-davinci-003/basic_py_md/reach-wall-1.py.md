The code should be:
```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the target"):
        robot.push("gripper over the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is below the target"):
        robot.reach("to the target")
```
