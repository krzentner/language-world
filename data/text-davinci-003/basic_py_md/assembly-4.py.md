The task to perform is quite specific - the robot must use its gripper to manoeuvre a wrench in order to secure the peg in the hole. With this in mind, the code might look like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the wrench is not above the peg"):
        robot.place("wrench above peg")
    if check("wrench is above peg and the robot's gripper is not around wrench"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not properly aligned with the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench with peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is aligned with peg"):
        robot.insert("wrench around peg")
```
