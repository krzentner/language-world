Then add the code below:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the peg is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.put("gripper left of peg")
    if check("the peg is left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not vertically aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    if check("the peg is vertically aligned with the robot's gripper and the wrench is not around the peg"):
        robot.wrap("wrench around peg")    
```
