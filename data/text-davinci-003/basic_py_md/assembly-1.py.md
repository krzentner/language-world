Then, add this code to the program:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above wrench and wrench is not in robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the wrench is in gripper and peg is not below gripper"):
        robot.move("gripper above peg")
    if check("peg is below gripper and the wrench is not around the peg"):
        robot.wrap("wrench around peg")
```
