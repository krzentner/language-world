The program should be as follows:
```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the wall is in between the gripper and the button"):      #check for wall
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the wall is in between the gripper and the button"):
        robot.reach("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
