The code will be:

```
# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
def pick_place(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.grab("puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.put("gripper above the target location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.put("gripper at the target location")
```
