The rest of the code would be:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the button is not above the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the button is above the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near button"):
        robot.put("gripper near button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is not directly above the button"):
        robot.move("gripper directly above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is directly above the button"):
        robot.push("button down")
```
