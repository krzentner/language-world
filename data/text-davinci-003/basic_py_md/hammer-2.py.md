The code for 'hammer' would look like this:

```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
def hammer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the hammer")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("the gripper around the hammer")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the nail"):
        robot.aim("the hammer at the nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the nail"):
        robot.strike("the nail with the hammer")
```
