```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick"):
        robot.put("gripper around stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around stick and the thermos is not within reach of the stick"):
        robot.move("stick towards thermos")
    if check("the thermos is ahead of the stick and the stick is not in contact with thermos"):
        robot.push("stick into thermos")
    if check("the stick is in contact with thermos and the thermos is not yet at the goal"):
        robot.slide("thermos to goal")
    if check("the thermos is at the goal"):
        robot.stop("motion")
