Here's the program for the `push` task:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.move("gripper to near puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
        robot.grab("puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("puck to goal")
```
