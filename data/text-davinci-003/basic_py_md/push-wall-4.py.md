The code for the program is as follows:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is below the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal, moving the wall out of the way")
```
