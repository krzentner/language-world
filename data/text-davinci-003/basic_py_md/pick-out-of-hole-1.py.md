The code should be: 

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg and the peg is in the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around hole"):
        robot.drop("gripper around hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around hole"):
        robot.pull("up on peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the peg"):
        robot.place("peg at goal")
```
