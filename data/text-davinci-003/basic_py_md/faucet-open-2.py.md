The program should be as follows:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around faucet")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```
