# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not above the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench with the peg")
    if check("the wrench is above the peg"):
        robot.pull("wrench off the peg")
