The code for this task should look like this:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck, the robot's gripper is closed, and the puck is blocked by the wall"):
        robot.go("forward two steps")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
