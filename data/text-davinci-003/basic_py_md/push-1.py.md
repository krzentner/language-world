The code to perform the task of pushing the puck to the target location would be:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.reach("to puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("puck to goal")
```
