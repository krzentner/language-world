Then, add the code:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg"):
        robot.pull("peg outward")
    if check("peg is somewhat loose but not out of hole"):
        robot.pull("peg outward again")
    if check("peg is loosely hanging from the hole"):
        robot.pull("peg out")
```
