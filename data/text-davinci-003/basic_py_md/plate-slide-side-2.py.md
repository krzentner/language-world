Here is the program:

```
# plate-slide-side: slide the plate sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate"):
        robot.align("gripper forward with plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not near the goal"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate"):
        robot.push("plate into goal")
```
