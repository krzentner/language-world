# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
def plate_slide_back(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate"):
        robot.push("gripper into plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.align("plate to target location")
    if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.slide("plate back into the target location")
