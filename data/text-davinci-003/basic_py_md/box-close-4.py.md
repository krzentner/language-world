The program would look like this:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.reach("gripper above box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is directly above box and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on box")
```
