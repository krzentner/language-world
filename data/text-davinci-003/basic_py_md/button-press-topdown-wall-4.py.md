The program should look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not close to the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper near the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.reach("over the wall to the button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
