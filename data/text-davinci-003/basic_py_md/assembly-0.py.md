Then, add the code:

```
# assembly: grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg
def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench to peg")
    if check("the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.wrap("wrench around peg")
```
