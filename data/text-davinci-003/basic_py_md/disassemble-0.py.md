Here's the code that needs to be written:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around it"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench"):
        robot.pull("the wrench away from the peg")
```
