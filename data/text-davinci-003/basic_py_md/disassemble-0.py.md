def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper around wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around wrench and the wrench is not pulled off peg"):
        robot.pull("wrench off peg")
