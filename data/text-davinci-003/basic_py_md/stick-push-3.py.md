Next, provide an action plan for the robot to complete this task:

```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the stick and the thermos is not below the stick"):
        robot.align("stick and thermos")
    if check("the thermos is below the stick"):
        robot.push("stick toward goal")
```
