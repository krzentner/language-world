The program should be as follows: 

```
# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("stick to the goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the thermometer is below the stick"):
        robot.push("stick towards the goal")
```
