```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick"):
        robot.put("gripper around stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around stick and robot's gripper is not near thermos"):
        robot.reach("gripper to thermos")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near thermos"):
        robot.pull("stick to reach goal")
