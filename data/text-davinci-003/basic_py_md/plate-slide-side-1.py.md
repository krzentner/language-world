if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
if check("the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
    robot.grab("plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate"):
    robot.slide("plate to the right")
if check("the robot's gripper is right aligned with the target location"):
    robot.push("plate into the goal")
