# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the wall and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck and wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the wall and the robot's gripper is not near puck and wall"):
        robot.push("gripper into puck and wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and wall and the puck and wall are below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("puck and wall to the goal")
