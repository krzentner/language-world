Your code should look like this:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the wall is blocking the way to the goal"): 
        robot.lift("puck above wall")
    if check("the wall is no longer blocking the way to the goal and the puck is not at the target location"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```
