 

The program should check whether the robot's gripper is not near the lever, and then move the gripper to the lever. Then, it should check if the lever is rotated down, and if so, rotate it up.

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near lever"):
        robot.move("gripper to lever")
    if check("the lever is rotated down"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```
