We can use this code to perform the task:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button and the short wall is blocking the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move("gripper to left or right of wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button"):
    robot.put("gripper above wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the short wall and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button"):
    robot.push("gripper into button")
```
