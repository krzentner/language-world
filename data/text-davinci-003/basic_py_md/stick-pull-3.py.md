```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.reach("to stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not grabbing the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the thermos is not in front of the robot's gripper and the thermos is not right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.place("stick ahead of thermos")
    if check("the thermos is right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("stick to the left")
    if check("the thermos is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("stick to the right")
    if check("the thermos is in front of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.push("stick forward and thermos to goal")
