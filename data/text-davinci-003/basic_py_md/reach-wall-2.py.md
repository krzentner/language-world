Solution:
```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.reach("to near the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the wall"):
        robot.align("with the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is slightly beyond the wall and the robot's gripper is up"):
        robot.move("past the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is past the wall and the robot's gripper is down"):
        robot.reach("over the wall to goal")
