The program should check for the following conditions: 

- the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the handle
- the robot's gripper is not to the side of the handle
- the robot's gripper is near the handle
- the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle

Assuming these conditions, the program should then complete the task by performing the correct actions:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
def handle_press_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper near handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the side of the handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to side of handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.align("gripper horizontally with handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```
