The program to perform the task would look like this:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
def plate_slide(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below plate and plate is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
```
