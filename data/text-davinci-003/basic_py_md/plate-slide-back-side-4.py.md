# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.grab("the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the goal"):
        robot.align("the plate to the goal")
    if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the goal"):
        robot.slide("plate back sideways")
