The program should look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
def plate_slide_back(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.put("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around plate and the plate is not below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("plate away from robot")
    if check("the plate is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
```
