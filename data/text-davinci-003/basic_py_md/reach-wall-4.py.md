```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not aligned with the wall surface"):
        robot.put("gripper at wall-level")
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the wall surface and the robot's gripper is not near the wall's edge"):
        robot.extend("gripper over the wall's edge")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall's edge and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the target location"):
        robot.align("gripper with target location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
