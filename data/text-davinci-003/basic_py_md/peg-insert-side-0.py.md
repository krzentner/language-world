The logic for the program should be as follows:

1. Check if the robot's gripper is not below the peg. 
	If it is not, the robot should put its gripper above the peg.

2. Check if the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the gripper is open.
	If it is not, the robot should put its gripper around the peg.

3. Check if the robot's gripper is near the peg, and the gripper is not open. 
	If it is not, the robot should close its gripper around the peg.

4. Check if the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the peg is below the robot's gripper. 
	If it is, the robot should move its gripper to the side of the peg so that the peg is now between the robot's gripper and the hole.

5. Check if the robot's gripper is near the peg. 
	If it is, the robot should insert the peg into the hole.

The full code should be as follows:

```
# peg-insert-side: grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the gripper is not open"):
        robot.close("gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the peg is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.put("gripper to the side of the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg"):
        robot.push("peg into the hole")
```
