def hammer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the nail"):
        robot.place("gripper above nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the nail and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the nail"):
        robot.align("gripper to nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the nail and the hammer is not within the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("hammer")
    if check("the hammer is within the robot's gripper"):
