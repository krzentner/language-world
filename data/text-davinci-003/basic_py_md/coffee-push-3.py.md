The code should look like this:

```
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
def coffee_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above mug"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug"):
        robot.grab("mug")
    if check("the mug is not in the target location"):
        robot.move("mug to goal")
    if check("the goal is reached"):
        robot.release("mug at goal")
```
