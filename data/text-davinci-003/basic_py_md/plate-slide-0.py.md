def plate_slide(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
