        robot.place("gripper around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not closed"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the robot's gripper is not near the hole"):
        robot.move("gripper near the hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the hole"):
