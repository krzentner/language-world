The rest of the code is:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```
