We can write the program as:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of the faucet handle"):
        robot.move("gripper in front of faucet")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet handle left")
```
