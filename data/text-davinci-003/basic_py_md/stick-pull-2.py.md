# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is open and not around the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.align("stick up with thermos")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("stick to goal")
    if check("the thermos is close to goal"):
        robot.hold("stick and slide to goal")
