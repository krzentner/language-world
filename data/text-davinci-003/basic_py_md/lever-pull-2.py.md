Solution:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lever and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever"):
        robot.align("gripper horizontally to lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.drop("gripper around lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```
