    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, drop it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is closed around the puck, move the puck close to the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck close to the wall.
    Now that the puck is close to the wall, the robot should lift up the puck and slide it into the wall. The wall should be blocking the opening of the gripper.
    - When the puck is close to the wall and the gripper is holding the puck, the robot should lift the puck and slide the puck into the wall.
    After the puck is inserted into the wall, the robot can carefully move the puck to the target location.
    - When the puck is inside the wall, the robot should carefully move puck to the goal.
