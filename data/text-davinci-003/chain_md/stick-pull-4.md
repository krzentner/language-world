    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Put the stick in the top of thermos  4. Pull the stick in the opposite direction of goal  5. Move the stick towards the target location
    Firstly, put the robot's gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the stick becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick. Because the stick is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the stick is not left of the robot's gripper and the stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the stick.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the stick and the stick isn't in the top of the thermos, insert the stick in the top of the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not in thermos, the robot should move stick in thermos.
    If the stick is in the thermos, pull the stick first in the opposite direction of the goal, followed by moving the stick towards the goal.
    - When the stick is in thermos, the robot should first pull the stick in the opposite direction of the goal, followed by moving the stick towards the goal.
