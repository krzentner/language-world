    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Grab the lever with the gripper  3. Rotate the lever up
    First, put the gripper above the lever, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    If the gripper isn't near the lever we can focus on grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near lever and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab lever.
    Once the gripper is around the lever, rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, the robot should rotate lever up.
