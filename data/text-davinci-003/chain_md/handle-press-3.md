    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Place gripper around handle  3. Push down on handle
    We need to start by putting the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above handle, the robot should place gripper above handle.
    If the gripper is not yet around the handle, move the gripper down to surround the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around handle.
    Finally, the robot can push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push down on handle.
