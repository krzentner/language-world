    Steps:  1. Position gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around ball  3. Close gripper around ball  4. Move robot with gripper towards the hoop  5. Shoot ball towards the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place gripper above ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around ball.
    Once the gripper is around the ball, close it to make sure we securely have it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around ball.
    Move the robot with the ball towards the hoop at a reasonable angle and speed.
    - When the robot is near the hoop, the robot should shoot the ball towards the hoop.
