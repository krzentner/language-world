    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the button  2. Push the button from the front
    We have a wall in the way, so we can't just line the gripper up with the button. We need to put the gripper somewhere else. We'll put it to the left side of the button, so that it can lean into the wall and still press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of button, the robot should put gripper left of button.
    Now that the gripper is next to the button, we can just push the button from the front without having to move the gripper any further. This should press the button reliably.
