    Steps:  1. Move the gripper towards the target location  2. Adjust the gripper's orientation as needed  3. Move the gripper forward along the desired path
    The first step is to move the gripper towards the target location. This should be done in a way that the gripper's orientation is maintained.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location.
    Once the gripper is close enough to the target location, its orientation may need adjustment in order to reach the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the target location but its orientation is not correct, the robot should adjust the gripper's orientation as needed.
    The final step is to move the gripper along the desired path until it reaches the desired target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the target location and its orientation is correct, the robot should move the gripper forward along the desired path.
