    Steps:  1. Put gripper below drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Push the drawer close
    To close the drawer, we need to keep the gripper below the drawer handle while we move it around.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, the robot should put gripper below drawer handle.
    Now that the gripper is below the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper up around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is below drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, the robot should put gripper around drawer handle.
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, just push the drawer close.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, the robot should push towards drawer.
