    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal  5. Push puck into the target
    First, place the gripper closely above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    If the gripper is roughly lined up with the puck we should be able to drop the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck, the robot should put gripper around puck.
    As long as the robot's gripper is still roughly around the puck, we can close the gripper to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We should now be holding the puck. Move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should move puck to goal location.
    If the puck is roughly at the goal location, try to push it into the target spot.
    - When the puck is at the goal location, the robot should push the puck into the target.
