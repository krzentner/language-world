    If the dial is not above the robot's gripper, we need to move the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, the robot should put the gripper above the dial.
    If the dial is still not aligned with the robot's gripper from the side, slide the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not side aligned with the dial, the robot should slide the gripper around the dial.
    Now that the dial is aligned with the gripper from the side, push it in the right direction.
