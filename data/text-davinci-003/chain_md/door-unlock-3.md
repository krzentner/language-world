    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial left or right  3. Feel for vibration or click when the dial is in the unlock position
    First, try to line the gripper up with the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    When the gripper is lined up, try turning the dial either left or right to unlock it.
    - When the gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn dial left or right.
    Once turning the dial produces a vibration or click, we should assume the dial is in the unlock position.
    - When the robot feels vibration or click when turning dial, the robot should assume dial is in unlock position.
