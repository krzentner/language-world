Steps:  1. Put the gripper in front of the mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Pull the mug towards the target location  4. Stop when mug is close to target location
    First, move the gripper so it is in front of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the mug, the robot should put gripper in front of mug.
    Now that the gripper is in front of the mug, we can try to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug, the robot should grab mug with gripper.
    Once the gripper is around the mug, we can start to move the mug by pulling it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug and the mug is not close to target location, the robot should pull mug towards target location.
    When the mug is close enough to the target location, stop pulling the mug.
    - When mug is close to target location, the robot should stop pulling mug.
