    Steps:  1. Put gripper just above the soccer ball  2. Push the soccer ball straight ahead  3. Move the robot and soccer ball to the target
    We'll need to raise the gripper slightly, as the soccer ball is a round object.
    - When the robot's gripper is not just above the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper just above soccer ball.
    Then, with the gripper slightly above the soccer ball, the robot can push the soccer ball by extending the arm straight ahead.
    - When the robot's gripper is just above the soccer ball, the robot should push the soccer ball straight ahead.
    We may need to follow the soccer ball to the target. When the soccer ball is near the target, move and rotate the arm as needed.
    - When the soccer ball is near the target, the robot should move the robot and soccer ball together to the target.
