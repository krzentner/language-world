    Steps:  1. Put gripper forward-aligned with soccer ball  2. Push soccer ball with gripper  3. Slightly lift gripper off soccer ball  4. Point gripper toward target and slide soccer ball
    First, move the gripper in front of the soccer ball and align it there.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward-aligned with soccer ball, the robot should move gripper in front of the soccer ball.
    We can basically touch the soccer ball with the gripper and push it forward.
    - When robot's gripper is forward-aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is far from soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball with gripper.
    If the robot's gripper is touching the soccer ball, point the gripper slightly up towards the target and slide the soccer ball.
    - When robot's gripper is touching soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not pointing towards the target, the robot should point gripper toward target and lift off soccer ball slightly.
