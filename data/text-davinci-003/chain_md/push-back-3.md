    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Push down the gripper to trap the puck  3. Slide the puck backwards to the target location 
    We need to put the gripper above the puck before we can push it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is roughly above the puck, try to trap the puck by pushing down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should push the gripper onto the puck.
    If the gripper is around the puck, we can slide it backwards by moving the gripper backwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the target location.
