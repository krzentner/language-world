    If the robot's gripper is not above the nail, we should move the gripper above the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place gripper above nail.
    Once the gripper is above the nail, we should try to line it up with the nail (left to right).
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with nail, the robot should align gripper with nail.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the nail, drop the gripper around the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle, the robot should put gripper around hammer handle.
    When the hammer is in the gripper, make sure it's lined up with the nail, then swing the hammer with a controlled force.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the nail, the robot should strike nail with hammer.
