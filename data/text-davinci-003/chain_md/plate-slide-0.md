    Steps:  1. Put gripper near wall and on top of the plate  2. Rotate the gripper to the side to have a firm grip on the plate  3. Slide plate to goal
    The plate can be heavy, so the robot should make sure to have a firm grip on the plate before sliding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near wall and not on top of the plate, the robot should put gripper near wall and on top of plate.
    When the gripper is near the wall and on top of the plate, rotate the gripper to the side to make sure it has a firm grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall and on top of plate and the gripper is not side aligned with plate, the robot should rotate gripper to the side.
    The robot has a firm grip on the plate and side aligned with it, so now it can slide the plate to the goal.
