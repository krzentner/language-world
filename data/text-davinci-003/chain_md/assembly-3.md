    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Grab wrench with gripper  3. Rotate wrench until peg is lined up  4. Wrap wrench around peg
    First, we need to put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wrench, the robot should move gripper above wrench.
    If the wrench is below the gripper, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wrench and robot's gripper is not around wrench, the robot should grab wrench.
    As long as the peg isn't lined up with the wrench, rotate the wrench with the gripper until the peg is lined up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench and the peg is not horizontally aligned with wrench, the robot should rotate wrench until peg is lined up.
    Now the peg is lined up with the wrench, so we can wrap the wrench around the peg.
    - When the peg is horizontally aligned with the wrench, the robot should wrap wrench around peg.
