    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the door handle  2. Push the door handle with the gripper  3. Push door closed with the gripper
    First, move the gripper near the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should place gripper near door handle.
    Once the gripper is near the door handle, push against the door handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the door handle is not pushed in, the robot should push against door handle with gripper.
    If the door handle is pushed in, push the door closed using the gripper. We don't need to worry about this step as much, as we don't have to be as precise.
    - When the door handle is pushed in, the robot should push the door closed with gripper.
