    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to target bin
    If we don't have a clear view of the cube, we can try to line up the gripper above the cube by moving it around.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the cube, we should be able to put the gripper around it by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we should be able to close the gripper and form a firm grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Now that the cube is held firmly by the gripper, we can move it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place cube into target bin.
