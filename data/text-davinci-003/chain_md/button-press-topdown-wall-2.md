Steps:  1. Move the robot's gripper closer to the wall  2. Put the gripper above the button  3. Push down—or pull up—on the button from the top
    First, we need to move the gripper closer to the wall so that it will have space to reach the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move gripper closer to wall.
    Once the gripper is close enough to the wall, we need to put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the button, push down (or pull up) on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, the robot should push down (or pull up) on the button.
