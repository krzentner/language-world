    Steps:  1. Align the robot's gripper with the button as seen from above  2. Place the robot's gripper against the wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    We need to line up the gripper with the button from above, but it is blocked by a wall.
    -When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Once the gripper is almost lined up, move the gripper to the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near wall, the robot should place gripper against wall.
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the wall and the button, we can push down on the button from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper against wall, the robot should push down on button.
