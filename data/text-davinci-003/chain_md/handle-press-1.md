    First we need to put the gripper above the handle so we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push the handle down.
