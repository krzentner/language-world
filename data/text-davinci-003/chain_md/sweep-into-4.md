    Steps:  1. Put gripper directly above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to goal
    We need to place our gripper directly above the cube first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, we can move it down to around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can close the gripper to securely grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    After closing the gripper, the cube should be securely held. Now move the cube to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube to goal.
