    Steps:  1. Move gripper to the top of the ball  2. Close gripper around the ball  3. Lift the ball up  4. Move the ball equipped to the hoop  5. Lower the ball into the hoop
    First, we need to get the robot's gripper to the top of the ball so it can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move gripper to top of ball.
    Now that the gripper is above the ball, close the gripper around it so we can lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around ball.
    As long as the gripper is still around the ball, lift it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift ball.
    The ball is still in the gripper and the gripper can move it, so move the ball to the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is above ball and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move ball to hoop.
    Once the ball is close to the hoop, lower it in gently. 
    - When the robot's gripper is close to hoop and the robot's gripper is holding the ball, the robot should lower ball into hoop.
