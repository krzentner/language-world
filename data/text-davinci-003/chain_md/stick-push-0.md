    Steps:  1. Put gripper just above stick  2. Close gripper around stick  3. Slide stick so it is horizontally aligned with thermos  4. Push thermos towards target with the stick
    First, put the gripper slightly above the stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place gripper above stick.
    Move the gripper down to the stick and try to close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around stick.
    Now that we have the stick in our gripper, move the stick so that it is horizontally aligned with the top of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick so it is aligned with the thermos.
    As long as the stick is aligned with the thermos, just push it towards the goal.
    - When the stick is horizontally aligned with thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the target.
