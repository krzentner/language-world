     Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the front  2. Push the button
    First, we need to align the gripper with the button, so that when the robot pushes, it will press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, the robot should move gripper forward to button. 
    If the gripper doesn't seem to line up with the button, maybe the gripper is a bit to the side, so we should move the gripper left or right until it lines up.
    - When the robot's gripper is side aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, the robot should move gripper left or right.
    Once the gripper is in the correct position, we can now push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button, the robot should push button.
