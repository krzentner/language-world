    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wall  2. Push gripper against wall  3. Push gripper against puck  4. Slide puck to goal
    We can start by moving the gripper above the wall, so that the robot can push against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall, the robot should put the gripper above wall.
    Now push the wall with the gripper, so that it's not in the way of the path to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is not pushing against wall, the robot should push against the wall.
    Now that the wall is shifted, the puck should be in reach of the gripper. Push the puck with the gripper from the side or from below.
    - When the robot's gripper is not pushing against the puck, the robot should push against the puck.
    Now that the puck is out of the way, slide it to the goal.
    - When the puck is near the goal and the robot's gripper is not pushing against the puck, the robot should slide puck to goal.
