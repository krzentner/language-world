    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck and line up with wall  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Slide puck to goal
    We need to line up the gripper with the wall before we move towards the goal in order to ensure that we don't bump the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not lined up with the wall, the robot should put the gripper above the puck and line up with wall.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, the wall is lined up, and the gripper is not around the puck, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We have closed the gripper, so we should check to make sure the grip is stable. Then, try to slide the puck towards the wall to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck and the wall is lined up, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
