    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull up on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    If the gripper is lined up with the handle, we can try to grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    Now that we have the handle gripped, we can start to pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should pull handle up.
