    First, put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below the handle, the robot should put gripper below handle.
    As long as the grippper is below the handle, we can probably grab it by moving the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    If the gripper is now around the handle, we can just pull handle up.
