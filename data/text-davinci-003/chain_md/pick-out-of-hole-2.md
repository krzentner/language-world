    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper around the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Place peg at goal
    First, orient the gripper above the hole, so that we don't knock the peg when trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
    Once the gripper is above the hole, we should be able to grab the peg by putting the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the peg.
    If the gripper is around the peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    Once we've got the peg, we should be able to lift it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift peg out of hole.
    After the peg is clear of the hole, move the peg to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the peg is clear of the hole, the robot should place peg at goal.
