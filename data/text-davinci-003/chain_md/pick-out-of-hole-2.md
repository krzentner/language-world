    If the peg isn't beneath the gripper, move the it above the peg to start.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg is now beneath the gripper, we can extend the gripper down into the hole to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not inside the hole, the robot should extend gripper down into hole.
    If the gripper is inside the hole, try to close it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside the hole and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the peg.
    The gripper should be closed now, so the robot can lift the peg out of the hole and try to move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the peg is still in the hole, the robot should lift peg out of hole.
    The peg should now be out of the hole, so move it to the goal. 
    - When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move peg to goal.
