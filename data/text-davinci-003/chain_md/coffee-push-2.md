    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Push gripper into mug  3. Move mug to goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, the robot should put gripper above mug.
    If the mug is just above the gripper, slide the gripper down to trap it. 
    - When the mug is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near mug, the robot should push the gripper into mug.
    If the mug is below the gripper, it should be trapped and the gripper should still be closed, otherwise go back an earlier step.
    - When the mug is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move mug to goal.
