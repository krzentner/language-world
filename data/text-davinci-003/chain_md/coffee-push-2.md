    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should put gripper above mug.
    Once the gripper is above the mug, lower the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower gripper around mug.
    Once the gripper is around the mug, close the gripper firmly to grab the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug.
