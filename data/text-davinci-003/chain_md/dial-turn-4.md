    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Grab dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial
    First, put the robot's gripper roughly above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the dial, we should be able to grab the dial by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, the robot should grab dial with gripper.
    Now that the dial is in the robot's gripper, we can turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, the robot should turn dial.
