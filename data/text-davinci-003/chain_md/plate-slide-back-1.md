    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push plate back  3. Place plate at target
    We need to place the gripper above the plate, in order to be able to grab the plate and slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, the robot should push the plate back.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not closer to target, the robot should push plate back.
    When the plate is close to the target location, place the plate with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is closer the target, the robot should place plate at target.
