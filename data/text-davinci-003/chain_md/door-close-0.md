    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the door handle  2. Push the door closed  3. Push the door closed harder
    First, put the gripper near the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should put gripper near door handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the door is not closed, then start pushing the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the door is not closed, the robot should push door closed.
    If the gripper must push harder, we might need to move the gripper to the door handle again. Because of lever forces, it will take more effort to close the door if the gripper is just above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the door is not closed, the robot should push door closed harder.
