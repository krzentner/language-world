    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the soccer ball  2. Push on the side of the soccer ball  3. Push the soccer ball to goal
    The robot can use a side-to-side pushing motion to move the soccer ball reliably. If it's not near the soccer ball, move the gripper next to the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the soccer ball.
    Once the gripper is next to the soccer ball, start pushing against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball, the robot should push the soccer ball to the side.
    Now that the robot is pushing against the soccer ball, just keep pushing until it reaches the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing against the soccer ball and the soccer ball is not at the goal, the robot should push the soccer ball to the goal.
