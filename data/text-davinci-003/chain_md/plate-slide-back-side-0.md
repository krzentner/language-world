    Steps:  1. Put gripper forward of the plate 2. Push the plate left to slide it back 3. Push the plate back further
    We should start by putting the gripper forward of the plate so that we have maneuvering space. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with plate, the robot should put gripper in front of plate.
    To start sliding the plate back, we should push the plate left. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the plate is not to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push plate left.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, we can push it further left to move it back into the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the plate is to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push plate back further.
