Steps:  1. Put the left side of the gripper above the window handle  2. Push the window closed   3. Push the window closed harder
    Before starting to push the window closed, we should put the left side of the gripper above the window handle. This way, when the robot pushes the window closed, the window handle will be below the robot's gripper and the robot will be able to push to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the window handle, the robot should put the left side of the gripper above the window handle.
    When the window handle is mostly below the robot's gripper, the robot should push the window closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the window handle, the robot should push window closed. 
    If the robot needs to push harder to get the window closed, then the robot should push the window closed harder.
    - When the window is not fully closed, the robot should push window closed harder.
