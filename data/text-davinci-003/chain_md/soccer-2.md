    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push grip into soccer ball  3. Push soccer ball in chosen direction
    The robotic gripper needs to be lined up above the soccer ball before we can attempt to push the ball into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
    If the gripper is lined up with the soccer ball, we can push the ball using the force of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball, the robot should push grip into soccer ball.
    We've trapped the soccer ball by pushing the gripper into it. Now push the ball into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball in chosen direction.
