Steps: 1. Put gripper near front of plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Push the plate harder in to target location
    To slide the plate back, the robot first needs to put the gripper near the front of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the front of the plate, the robot should put gripper near front of plate.
    If the plate is at least aligned with the gripper as seen from the side, we can start pushing it back.
    - When the plate is side aligned with the robot's gripper and the plate is not in the target location, the robot should push the plate back.
    If the plate is almost in the target location, apply more pressure to push it in all the way.
    - When the plate is nearly in target location and the robot gripper is near the front of the plate, the robot should push the plate back harder.
