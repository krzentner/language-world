    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever  2. Grab the lever with the gripper  3. Push the lever upward  4. Rotate the lever up
    First, line the gripper up above the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    Once the gripper is lined up, grab the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab lever.
    Now that the gripper is grabbing the lever from the top, we just need to rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should rotate lever up.
