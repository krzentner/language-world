    First, put the gripper above the lever to get a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    Once the gripper is above the lever, start rotating the lever around the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lever, the robot should rotate lever up with the gripper.
    As long as the lever isn't up, push harder and continue rotating until the lever is up.
    - When the lever is not up and the robot's gripper is above the lever, the robot should push lever up harder.
