    Steps:  1. Put gripper beside handle  2. Pull the handle towards the gripper  3. Lift up the handle with the gripper
    First, move the gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beside handle, the robot should move gripper beside handle.
    Now that the gripper is beside the handle, we can just pull it towards the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is beside handle, the robot should pull handle to robot.
    We've drawn the handle close enough, so let's lift it up.
