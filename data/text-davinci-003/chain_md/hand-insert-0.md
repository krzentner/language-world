    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Close gripper around puck  3. Move puck to goal
    First, position the gripper so that it is above the puck. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If we have the gripper above the puck, close the gripper around it to pick it up. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
    Move the puck to the goal location, with the gripper still closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to the goal.
