Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck, close the gripper so that it picks up the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the target location. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to goal.
