    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line the stick up next to the thermos  4. Push the stick against the thermos to push it to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the stick becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick. Because the stick is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the side instead of around it.
    - When stick is not left of the robot's gripper and stick is not side aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    If the gripper is side-aligned with the stick we can now push the stick against the thermos to slide it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is side aligned with the stick and the gripper is not pushing against the thermos, the robot should push the stick against the thermos.
    If the stick is pushing against the thermos, slide the stick and thermos towards the goal location.
    - When the stick is pushing against the thermos, the robot should push the stick and thermos to the goal.
