Steps: 1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper around hole  3. Close gripper firmly on peg  4. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the hole, so that we can assess it better. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should place gripper above the hole.
    If the gripper isn't below the peg, put it below the peg so that it can better sense and close on the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    Once the gripper is near the peg, we should close the gripper firmly on the peg to ensure that we can grab and move it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper firmly on peg.
    Now that the robot has the peg, move it to the goal. Keep a tight grip on the peg to make sure it doesn't drop out of the hole. 
    - When the robot's gripper is below peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move peg to goal.
