Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the handle as viewed from the side  2. Push down on the handle  3. Move the handle left or right as needed
    First, we need to line up the gripper with the handle as seen from the side, to prevent the handle from slipping off.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper next to handle.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, it can push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle, the robot should push down handle.
    If the handle doesn't slide, it may be blocked, so try pushing the handle left or right until it slides.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the handle is blocked, the robot should move handle left or right.
