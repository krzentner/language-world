    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Push against the wall  4. Slide puck to goal
    We need to move the robot's gripper to the puck before we can start pushing against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    Now the robot can start to move the puck. Touch the wall with the gripper and the puck at the same time.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    Now the robot can start to push the puck forward. It will attempt to duck under the wall and move towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and near the puck, the robot should push the puck against the wall and slide it to the goal.
