Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly above the door handle 2. Drop gripper around door handle 3. Pull open the door
If the gripper is not above the door handle, move it to the door handle. We want to line up the gripper with the handle as seen from the side, because we need to get a good grip on the handle to be able to pull it open.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle and the robot's gripper is not side aligned with the door handle, the robot should move gripper to above door handle.
Once the gripper is side aligned, drop the gripper around the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is side aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, the robot should put gripper around door handle. 
Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just pull the door open.
- When the robot's gripper is around the door handle, the robot should pull away from door.
