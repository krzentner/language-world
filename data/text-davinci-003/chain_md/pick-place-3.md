    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the gripper to the target location  4. Release the puck at the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    After the gripper is above the puck, it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck, the robot should grab puck.
    When the puck is in the gripper, we can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper has the puck, the robot should move gripper to target.
    Once the gripper is at the target location, the robot can release the puck.
