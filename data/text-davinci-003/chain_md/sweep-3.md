    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab cube with gripper  3. Move cube sideways to target
    First, we need to put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is roughly lined up above the cube, move the gripper down around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, the robot should grab cube with gripper.
    Now that the cube is tightly in the grip of the robot, we can just move it sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the cube is not beside target location, the robot should move cube sideways to target.
