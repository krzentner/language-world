Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    First, the robot should put the gripper roughly above the cube so that it can grab it without bumping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, then the robot should put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube. 
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, close the gripper around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    We've closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so we've probably grabbed it. Now try to move the cube sideways to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube sideways to goal.
