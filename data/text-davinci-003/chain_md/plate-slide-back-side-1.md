    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Line up the gripper with the plate from above  3. Slide the plate back sideways
    Because the plate needs to be slid back into the target location, it's best to approach the plate from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    As long the gripper is lined up with the plate from the top, move the gripper towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, the robot should move gripper towards the target location.
    If the plate is close enough, slide the plate back sideways into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should slide plate back sideways.
