    First, put the gripper roughly above the lock, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the door lock, the robot should put gripper above door lock.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the door lock, we should be able to grab the door lock by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door lock and the robot's gripper is not around door lock, the robot should put gripper around door lock.
    Once the gripper is around the door lock, we can just turn the dial in the desired direction.
