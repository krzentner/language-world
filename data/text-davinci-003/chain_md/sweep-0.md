Steps:  1. Reach towards cube  2. Put gripper beside cube  3. Clamp the cube with the gripper  4. Move the cube sideways to target location
    First, reach towards the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, the robot should reach towards cube.
    If the cube is right of the gripper, move the gripper sideways to the cube.
    - When the cube is right of the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper beside cube.
    Once the gripper is beside the cube, we should be able to grab it by closing the gripper around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is beside the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should clamp the cube with the gripper.
    Now, with the cube clamped in the gripper, we can move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is clamped around the cube, the robot should move cube sideways to target location.
