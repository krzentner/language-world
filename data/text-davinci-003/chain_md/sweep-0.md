    Steps:  1. Grab the cube from the top  2. Place cube in the location  3. Move sideways the cube to the target location
    First, the robot must grab the cube from the top. This would involve putting the gripper over the cube, and then dropping the gripper around the cube. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, the robot can then lift it up and start moving it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and cube is not in the location, the robot should place cube in location.
    The robot should then move slightly sideways until the cube is in the desired position.
    - When the cube is in the location and the cube is not at the target location, the robot should move sideways the cube to the target location.
