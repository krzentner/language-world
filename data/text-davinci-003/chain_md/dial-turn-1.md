    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Put gripper around dial  3. Turn the dial
    We need to put the gripper near the dial before we can turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    As long as the dial is not lined up with the gripper, move the gripper so that it's around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    We can now turn the dial, either by pushing or pulling depending on which direction you want the dial to turn.  
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, the robot should turn dial.
