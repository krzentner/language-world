    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push against puck to move it  3. Move puck to goal
    We need to put the gripper behind the puck to be able to push it in the correct direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, the robot should move gripper behind puck.
    If the gripper is still behind the puck, we can start pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck, the robot should push puck.
    Now we should keep pushing the puck and adjust the angle as necessary until it reaches the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the goal, the robot should move puck to goal.
