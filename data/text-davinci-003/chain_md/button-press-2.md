    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper from the front  2. Push in on the button from the front
    We can do this task the same way we do a `peg-insert-side` - line up the robot's gripper with the button from the front, then grab it and slide it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, the robot should put gripper in front of button.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the button, we can just push in on it.
