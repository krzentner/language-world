    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Drop gripper around the stick  3. Close gripper around the stick  4. Push thermos with the stick  5. Move thermos to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place gripper above stick.
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around stick.
    Once the gripper is around the stick, close the gripper to make sure we can move it without losing control.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around stick.
    With the stick in its grip, the robot can then push the thermos toward the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the thermos is not at goal, the robot should move thermos by pushing with stick.
    Once the thermos is lined up with the goal, the robot can push a little harder to slide it to the goal.
    - When thermos is at goal, the robot should push thermos to goal.
