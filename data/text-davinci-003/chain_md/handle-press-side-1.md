    Steps:  1. Put gripper beside the handle  2. Push down on the handle
    We need to first put the robot's gripper beside the handle. We don't want to put it above the handle, because pushing down might be harder from that position.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beside the handle, the robot should put gripper beside handle.
    If the handle is below the gripper, push down to press it.
    - When the handle is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push down handle.
