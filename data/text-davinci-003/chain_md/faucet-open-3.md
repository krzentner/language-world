    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around faucet handle  3. Turn handle left  4. Keep hold handle to left
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle, the robot should put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    If the gripper is aligned with the faucet handle but not near it, move the gripper down to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper around faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, it can turn the handle to the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, the robot should turn handle left.
    If the gripper has now turned the handle to the left, we need to make sure the handle stays to the left.
    - When the robot's gripper has turned the handle to the left, the robot should hold handle to left.
