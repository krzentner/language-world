    First, put the gripper more or less above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above box lid, the robot should place gripper above box lid.
    Keep the gripper as close to vertical as possible, so when we start closing it it will line up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is not yet closed, the robot should grab box lid.
    Now that the gripper is closed and the robot has a good grip on the box lid, let's start the movement to the box.
