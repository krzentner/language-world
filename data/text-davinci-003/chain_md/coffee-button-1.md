    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Drop gripper around button  3. Push button down
    First, put the gripper above the button. We may need to line up the gripper with the button from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above button and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    The robot should then drop the gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not around button, the robot should place gripper around button.
    Finally, the robot should push the button down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around button, the robot should push button down.
