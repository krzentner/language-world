    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Push the peg towards the robot  4. Pull the peg out from the side
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    Now the gripper is around the peg. Push it in the direction of the robot, so that it becomes left of the gripper.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should push peg towards robot.
    When the peg becomes left of the gripper, pull it out from the side.
    - When peg is left of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull peg out from the side.
