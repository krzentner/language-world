     Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with gripper  3. Line plate up with target  4. Slide plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab plate.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target, line up the plate with the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target, the robot should align plate to target.
    If the plate is lined up with the target, to the side, slide it in.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target, the robot should slide plate into target.
