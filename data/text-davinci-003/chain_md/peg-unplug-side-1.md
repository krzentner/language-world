 
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Rotate the peg so it is aligned to the vertical  4. Slide the peg sideways out of the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
   -  When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg. 
   If the peg becomes right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
   - When peg is not right of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg. 
   As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg, rotate the peg so it is aligned to the vertical.
   - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not vertically aligned with hole, the robot should rotate peg to be vertical.
   If the peg is vertical, we can slide it sideways out of the hole.
   - When peg is vertically aligned with hole, the robot should slide peg out of hole.
