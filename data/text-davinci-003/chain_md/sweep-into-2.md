    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the cube  2. Line up the gripper with the cube  3. Close the gripper around the cube  4. Move the cube to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the cube isn't lined up with the gripper, line it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with cube, the robot should line up gripper with cube.
    If the gripper is close to the cube, we can close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    If the gripper is closed, we can grab the cube and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube, the robot should move cube to goal.
