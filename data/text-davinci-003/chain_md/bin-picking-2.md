    To pick up the cube, first the robot needs to put the gripper near the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper near cube.
    If the gripper is near the cube but it's not closing around it, close the gripper and make sure we have a secure grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is not closing, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is closed, and the cube is being held, move the cube to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding cube, the robot should move cube to goal.
    Now that the robot has the cube, it can place the cube in the target bin.
    - When cube is at goal, the robot should place cube in target bin.
