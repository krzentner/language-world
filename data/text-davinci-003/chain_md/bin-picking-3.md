    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to bin  5. Drop cube in bin
    We should put the gripper above the cube, so that the gripper can grab the cube without bumping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If we can't see the cube, move around until its below the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the cube is not below the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper around cube.
    Once we can see the cube, move the gripper into the cube, and close the gripper to make sure its grabbed.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Now that the cube is safely grabbed, move it to the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above bin and the cube is above bin, the robot should move cube to bin.
    Finally, open the gripper to drop the cube in the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above bin and the cube is inside gripper, the robot should drop cube in bin.
