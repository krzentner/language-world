    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lower the wrench so it wraps around the peg  4. Rotate the wrench down to lock it in place
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should place the gripper above the wrench.
    If the wrench isn't left of the gripper, move the gripper to the left side of the wrench to grab it.
    - When the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench.
    Now that the gripper is around the wrench, we can lower it down so that it wraps around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench, the robot should lower wrench around peg.
    When the robot's gripper is around the peg, rotate the wrench to lock in it place.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should rotate wrench down to lock in place.
