Steps: 1. Put gripper near the wrench  2. Close gripper around the wrench  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    We don't want to put the gripper right on the peg, because that might push the wrench off the peg sideways. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench, the robot should place gripper near wrench.
    We don't want the wrench to fall, so we should close the gripper around the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around wrench.
    The gripper is closed, now the robot can pull the wrench off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull wrench off peg.
