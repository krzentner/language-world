Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper against back of puck  3. Slide puck backwards to goal 
First, put the gripper behind the puck instead of above it. This will give the robot enough leverage to slide it without lifting it up. 
- When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper behind the puck.
When the robot's gripper is behind the puck but not near it, we can move the gripper to gently push it and start sliding it back. 
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper against the back of the puck. 
When the gripper is near the puck, slide the puck back with short, consistent pushes of the gripper until it reaches the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal.
