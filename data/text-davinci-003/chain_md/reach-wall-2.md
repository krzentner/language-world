    Steps:  1. Rotate gripper so gripper is perpendicular to the wall  2. Reach around the wall and to the target 
    If the wall is in the way, the robot needs to reach around the wall to get to the target. Since the wall is short, we can just rotate the gripper so it is perpendicular to the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not perpendicular to wall, the robot should rotate gripper so gripper is perpendicular to wall.
    Once the gripper is in the right orientation, reach around the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is perpendicular to wall, the robot should reach to goal.
