    Steps:  1. Put gripper near plate  2. Slide plate sideways
    First, put the gripper near the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should put gripper near plate.
    Now that the gripper is near the plate, we can slide it by moving the gripper sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location or the robot's gripper is not sideways aligned with the plate, the robot should slide the plate sideways.
