    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push plate with gripper  3. Slide into position
    Put the gripper above the plate because it's a flat object and won't work with a side alignment.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, apply downward pressure to push the plate so that its edge is lined up with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate, the robot should push plate with gripper.
    Now that the plate's edge is lined up with the target location, move the gripper right or left to slide the plate into position.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is aligned with target location, the robot should slide plate into position.
