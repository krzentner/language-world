    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push into soccer ball and let the ball move to goal  3. Keep pushing the soccer ball until it reaches goal
    First, put the gripper above soccer ball so that the robot doesn't accidentally kick it away.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball, the robot should put the gripper above soccer ball.
    Next, lightly push the soccer ball forward towards the target location. If the soccer ball is to the left or right of the gripper, move the gripper so that it's directly above the ball again.
    - When the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and soccer ball moves away from target goal, the robot should move gripper above soccer ball.
    
Once the soccer ball is on its way, keep pushing the soccer ball until it reaches the target location. 
- When the soccer ball is moving to the target goal, the robot should keep pushing the soccer ball.
