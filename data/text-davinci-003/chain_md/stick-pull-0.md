    Once the stick is grabbed, it's time to start pulling. Pull the thermos to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick near the thermos, the robot should pull the thermos to the goal.
    Once the thermos is at the target location, release the stick.
    - When the thermos is at the goal, the robot should release the stick.
