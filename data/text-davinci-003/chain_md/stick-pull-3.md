Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line the stick up with the handle of the thermos  4. Pull the thermos towards the goal
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the stick becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick. Because the stick is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When stick is not left of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    As long the gripper is still around the stick and the stick isn't aligned with the handle of the thermos, line up the stick with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not aligned with the handle of the thermos, the robot should align stick to thermos handle.
    If the stick is lined up with the thermos handle, pull the thermos towards the goal.
    - When the stick is aligned with the thermos handle, the robot should pull thermos towards goal.
