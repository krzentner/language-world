    Steps: 1. Put gripper above box lid  2. Drop gripper around box lid  3. Close gripper around box lid  4. Move box lid to box  5. Lift and place box lid on box 
    First, put the gripper mostly above the box lid so that the robot won't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above box lid, the robot should place gripper above box lid.
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around box lid.
    If the gripper is near the box lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around box lid.
    We closed the gripper, and the box lid is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the box lid to the box. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move box lid to box.
    To place the box lid on the box, lift the closed gripper and do a gentle maneuver to place the box lid on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is near box and the gripper is closed, the robot should lift and place box lid on box.
