    Steps:  1. Put gripper on left side or right side of soccer ball  2. Push on the side of the soccer ball  3. Slide the soccer ball to goal
    First, we need to get the side of the robot's gripper near the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the left or right side of soccer ball, the robot should move gripper to left or right side of soccer ball.
    If the gripper is on one of the sides of the soccer ball, push on it to get it to move.
    - When the Robot's gripper is near left or right side of soccer ball and the soccer ball is not moving, the robot should push soccer ball.
    Now that the soccer ball is moving, slide it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing the soccer ball and soccer ball is moving, the robot should slide soccer ball to the goal.
