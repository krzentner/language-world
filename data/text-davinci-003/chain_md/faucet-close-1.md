    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper  3. Turn the faucet handle clockwise
    We should first put the gripper above the faucet handle so that we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
    If the gripper is aligned to the faucet handle from above, we can grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, the robot should put gripper around faucet handle.
