    First, put the gripper above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should put gripper above the wall.
    Then move the gripper just beyond the button so it can grab it. It doesn't need to be exact, because it's a short wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is above the wall and above the button, it can put the gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around button, the robot should drop gripper around button.
    Once the gripper is around the button, it can push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is around button, the robot should push down on button.
