    We need to line up the gripper with the button, but because there is a short wall blocking our view, we cannot see it from above. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost above button, the robot should put gripper above wall.
    The gripper should be moved over the wall first, so that it can be lined up with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the short wall and not above the button, the robot should move gripper over wall.
    Once the gripper is above the button, push down to press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, the robot should push down on button.
