    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper behind the puck. The robot should line up the gripper from the side as viewed from behind.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should put gripper behind puck.
    If the gripper is behind the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
