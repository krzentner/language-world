    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing into its back and moving the gripper. First, move the gripper so that it is behind the puck.     
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should put the gripper behind the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper up to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
