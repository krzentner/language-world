    If the gripper is aligned with the stick but not yet around it, move the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with stick and the robot's gripper is not around it, the robot should drop gripper around stick.
    When the gripper is around the stick, close it to grab it firmly.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around stick.
    When the gripper is closed around the stick, move the stick to find the edge of the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should find edge of thermos with the stick.
    When the robot finds the edge of the thermos, use the stick and the gripper to pull it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick, the robot should pull thermos with the stick.
