Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle of mug  2. Drop gripper around handle of mug  3. Close gripper around handle of mug  4. Pull the mug in the direction of the goal
    First, we want to line up the gripper above the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle of the mug, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle of the mug but not holding it, try to grab the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is near handle of mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle.
    If the gripper is already around the handle, we can close it and try to pull the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not closed, the robot should close gripper around mug handle.
    If the robot's gripper is closed, start pulling the mug in the direction of the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull mug towards goal.
