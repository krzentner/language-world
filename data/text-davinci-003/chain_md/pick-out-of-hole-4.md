    Steps:  1. Put gripper above hole  2. Drop gripper into hole  3. Close gripper around peg  4. Lift peg out of hole  5. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper above the hole. This is the only way of reaching the peg that is in the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should put gripper above hole.
    Once above the hole, the gripper needs to be aimed correctly so that it can reach into the hole and make contact with the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not directly forward aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is not in the hole, the robot should drop gripper into hole.
    With the gripper in contact with the peg, the robot needs to close the gripper around it so that it doesn't fall or slide out.
    - When the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's grip is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    Now the robot can lift the peg out of the hole, so that it can be moved to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is in the hole, the robot should lift peg out of hole.
    The peg is now out of the hole, so the robot can just take it to the goal.
    - When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move peg to goal.
