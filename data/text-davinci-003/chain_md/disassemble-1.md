Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Grab wrench with gripper  3. Pull wrench straight up
    First, line up the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    If the wrench is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the wrench. We want to make sure it lines up as seen from the front, since it's a long object.
    - When the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab wrench with gripper.
    Once the wrench is in the gripper, pull it straight up.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench, the robot should pull wrench straight up.
