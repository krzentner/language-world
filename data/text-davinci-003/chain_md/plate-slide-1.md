    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the edge of the plate  2. Grab the plate by the edge  3. Slide the plate to the target location
    Make sure that the gripper is near the edge of the plate before grabbing it, so we have a good grip. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the plate, the robot should put gripper near edge of plate.
    Now that the grip is lined up with the edge of the plate, close the gripper tight and slide the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the edge of plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab plate by edge.
    If the plate is located in front of the gripper as seen from above, we can keep sliding the plate to the target location by slowly moving the gripper. If the plate is too far away, move the gripper back towards the plate before pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the edge of the plate and the plate is forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should slide plate to goal.
