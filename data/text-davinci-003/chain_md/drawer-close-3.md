Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Push the drawer close 
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, the robot should put gripper above drawer handle. 
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, the robot should put gripper around drawer handle. 
    Now that the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just push it closed. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, the robot should push drawer closed.
