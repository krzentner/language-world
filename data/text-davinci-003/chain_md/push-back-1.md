    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper behind the puck as viewed from the side. Depending on the angle of the robot's gripper, that could mean just under the puck or beyond it.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the puck and the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, the robot should put gripper behind puck.
    If the gripper is in roughly the same column as the puck, we can start pushing the gripper against the back of the puck in order to move it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is not in contact with the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the back of the puck.
    If the gripper is moving the puck, continue pushing the puck until it reaches the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is in contact with the puck and the puck is not at goal, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
