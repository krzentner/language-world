    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate handle  2. Grab plate handle with gripper  3. Slide plate back sideways  4. Push plate into goal
    We need to put the gripper above the plate handle before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with plate handle, the robot should put gripper above plate handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the plate handle, we should be able to grab the plate handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate handle and the robot's gripper is not around plate handle, the robot should put gripper around plate handle.
    Now that the robot's gripper is around the plate handle, move the robot back to slide the plate. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate handle and the robot is not sliding plate back, the robot should slide plate back.
    Once the robot is sliding the plate, push harder to push the plate into the goal location.
    - When the robot is sliding plate back, the robot should push plate into goal.
