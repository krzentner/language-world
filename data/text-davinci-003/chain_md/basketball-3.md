    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball  3. Close gripper around the ball  4. Move the ball towards the hoop  5. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper on the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should put gripper above ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around ball.
    If the gripper is near the ball and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around ball.
    We closed the gripper, and the ball is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the ball towards the hoop.
    The robot should now be close enough to the hoop that the robot can just let go of the ball to score.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the hoop, the robot should release the ball into the hoop.
