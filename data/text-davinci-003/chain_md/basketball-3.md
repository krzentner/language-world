    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the basketball  2. Move gripper to the left of the hoop  3. Lift the ball slightly off the ground  4. Aim the ball towards the hoop  5. Throw the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the basketball. From this view, make sure the gripper is as small as possible so that we have the best shot at trying to throw it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the basketball, the robot should put gripper above basketball.
    Move the gripper to the left of the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is not to the left of the hoop, the robot should move gripper to the left of the hoop.
    Lift the ball slightly off the ground so that we can see where we want to throw it.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the left of the hoop and the ball is still on the ground, the robot should lift ball slightly off the ground.
    Now that the ball is off the ground, we can aim the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper has lifted the ball off the ground, the robot should aim ball towards hoop.
    Finally, throw the ball into the hoop.
    - When robot's gripper is aiming ball towards hoop, the robot should throw ball into hoop.
