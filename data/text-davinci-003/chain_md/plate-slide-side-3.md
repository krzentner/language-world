    Steps:  1. Grab the plate from the side of the plate  2. Push the plate sideways until it aligns with the target  3. Slide the plate away from the gripper until it's at the target location
    First, grab the plate from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should put gripper near plate.
    If the plate isn't aligned with the target, we should move it.
    - When the plate is not aligned with target, the robot should push plate sideways until it is aligned with target.
    Once the plate is aligned with the target, we can slide it away.
    - When the plate is aligned with target and the robot's gripper is near plate, the robot should slide plate away from gripper until it is at target location.
