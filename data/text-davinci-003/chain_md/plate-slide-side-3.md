    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Line up plate and target location  3. slide the plate sideways into target location
    First, put the gripper around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    We need to line up the plate and the target location, so that when the plates slides, it goes where it needs to go. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target, the robot should align plate to goal.
    Once the plate is aligned with the target, it's time to slide it in.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target, the robot should slide the plate sideways into the target location.
