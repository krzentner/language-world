    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line up the wrench with the peg  4. Drop the wrench onto the peg  5. Twist the wrench until it’s around the peg 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the wrench is still too high and the peg isn't aligned with the wrench yet, line up the wrench and the peg.
    - When the wrench is too high and the peg is not forward aligned with the wrench, the robot should line up wrench and peg.
    As long as the wrench and peg are lined up, close the gripper to drop the wrench onto the peg.
    - When the wrench is forward aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop wrench onto peg.
    Once the wrench is on the peg, twist the wrench until it’s around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should twist wrench until it's around peg.
