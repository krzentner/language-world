    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the podium  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Line up the wrench with the peg  4. Wrap the wrench around the peg  5. Move the wrench around the peg
    First, put the gripper above the podium to indicate where the wrench is.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the podium, the robot should put gripper above podium.
    Once the gripper is near the wrench, it should be able to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the wrench.
    Now that the gripper has the wrench, we can line up the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the peg is not aligned with the wrench, the robot should align wrench to peg.
    Once the wrench and the peg are lined up, we should be able to wrap the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the wrench is aligned with the peg, the robot should wrap the wrench around the peg.
    This should wrap the wrench around the peg. If the robot needs to secure the peg further, it can move the wrench around the peg. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the wrench is around the peg, the robot should move the wrench around the peg.
