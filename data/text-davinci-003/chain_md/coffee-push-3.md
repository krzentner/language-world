    First, we need to make sure the robot's gripper is above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug handle, the robot should place gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is above the mug handle, we can grab it by dropping the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, the robot should grab mug handle.
    If the gripper is around the mug handle and the mug is below the gripper as seen from in front, we can push it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and mug is below gripper as viewed from in front, the robot should push mug to goal.
