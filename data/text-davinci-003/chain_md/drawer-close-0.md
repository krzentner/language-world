The steps that the robot should perform to push the drawer close reliably are as follows: 
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Push the drawer handle inwards  3. Slide the drawer back in
    First, the robot should make sure the gripper is above the drawer handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the drawer handle, the robot should put the gripper above the drawer.
    With the gripper above the drawer, the robot should gently push the drawer handle inwards towards the drawer.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the drawer handle and the drawer handle is not pushed in, the robot should push the handle inwards.
    Finally, the robot should use its gripper to slide the drawer back into the cabinet.
    - When the drawer handle is pushed in and the drawer is not in the cabinet, the robot should slide the drawer back in.
