    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Grip the peg  4. Slide the peg into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    If the gripper is near the peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.  
    - When the robot's gripper is near peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grip the peg.
    We closed the gripper, and the peg is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Now we need to slide the peg into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide peg into hole.
