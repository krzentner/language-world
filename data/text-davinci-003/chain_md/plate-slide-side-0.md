    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    Once the plate is aligned with the gripper, move the gripper slightly lower to make sure the plate is lined up with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, but the plate is not in line with the target location, the robot should align the plate with the target location.
    Once the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot can slide it sideways into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate sideways into the target location.
