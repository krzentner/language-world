    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the handle  2. Start pushing up on the handle from the side  3. Push harder up on the handle
    Since we need to pull the handle up from the side, we need to start with the gripper on the left side. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the handle, the robot should move gripper to left of handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the handle, we can probably pull it up now by pushing up on it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the handle and the robot's gripper is near handle, the robot should push up on handle.
        If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of handle, the robot should push up on handle harder.
