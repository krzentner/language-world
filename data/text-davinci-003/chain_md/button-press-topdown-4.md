Steps:  1. Put gripper centred above button  2. Push down with the gripper  3. Release gripper
    First, make sure the gripper is centred above the button, so that it will push down evenly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not centred above button, the robot should put gripper centred above button.
    We don't need to be exact here - just make sure the gripper is mostly in the centre of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is centred above button and the robot's gripper is not pushing down, the robot should push down with gripper.
    Once the gripper is pushing down, keep it pressed for whatever duration you need for the button to be pressed.
    - When the robot's gripper is centred above button and the robot's gripper is pushing down, the robot should hold down with gripper.
    When the button has been pressed for long enough, open the gripper so that it's not pressing down on the button any more.
    - When the robot's gripper is centred above button and the robot's gripper is pushing down, the robot should release gripper.
