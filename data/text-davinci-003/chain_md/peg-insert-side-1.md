    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the peg  2. Grab the peg using the gripper  3. Rotate the peg  4. Place the peg in the hole 
    First, put the gripper near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should place the gripper near the peg.
    Now that the gripper is near the peg, close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
    Once the peg is securely in the gripper, rotate it so the wide part with the rounded edges is facing the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is facing wrong direction, the robot should rotate the peg.
    Now that the peg is in the correct orientation, we can try to place the peg in the hole. Push it in and see if it fits.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hole, the robot should place the peg in the hole.
