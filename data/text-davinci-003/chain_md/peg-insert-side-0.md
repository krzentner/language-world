    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Align gripper horizontally with hole  4. Push peg into hole
    We need to pick up the peg before we can insert it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the gripper is above the peg, but not completely lined up with the edge, line it up by moving it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    Now we should be lined up horizontally with the hole. We can now push the peg in.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should push peg into hole.
