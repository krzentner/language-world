    Steps:  1. Put gripper to left or right of wall  2. Push downwards on the button through wall
    Because the wall is short, we don't need to worry about the angle. We can put the gripper to the left or right of the wall and start pushing down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall and the robot's gripper is not towards the button, the robot should put gripper near wall.
    From there, we should be able to push on the button through the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the button is below the wall, the robot should push downwards button through wall.
