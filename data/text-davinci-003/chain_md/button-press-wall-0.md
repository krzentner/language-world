    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wall 2. Line up the gripper as viewed from the side  3. Lower the gripper to push the button 
    First, put the gripper above the wall since this will prevent the robot's gripper from running into the wall while trying to grab the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should place gripper above the wall.
    Next, line up the gripper so that it can be seen from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not side aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is above the wall but not forward aligned with the button, the robot should line up gripper as viewed from the side.
    If the gripper is forward aligned but not close enough to the button, lower the gripper to push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not close enough to button, the robot should lower gripper to push button.
