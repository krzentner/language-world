Steps:  
1. Put gripper above puck 
2. Drop gripper around puck 
3. Close gripper around puck 
4. Move puck away from wall 
5. Move puck to goal 

First, put the gripper above the puck so that we don't bump the wall while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
We closed the gripper, and the wall is still near the puck, so move the puck away from the wall. 
- When the robot's gripper is near wall and the puck is near wall, the robot should move puck away from wall.
Once the puck is away from the wall, it can be moved to the goal. 
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and the puck is away from wall, the robot should place puck at goal.
