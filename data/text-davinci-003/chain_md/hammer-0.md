    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Put the hammer head against the nail  3. Push the hammer head into the nail to drive it in
    Because this is a hit task, we need to align the robot's gripper from above in order to get the right angle when hitting.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the nail, the robot should put gripper above nail.
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can lower the hammer head until it touches the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above nail and the robot's gripper has hammer, the robot should put hammer head against nail.
    As long as the gripper is still lined up with the nail and the hammer is still touching it, keep pushing the hammer head into the nail.
    - When the gripper is vertically aligned with the nail and the hammer is pressing against the nail, the robot should push hammer head into nail.
