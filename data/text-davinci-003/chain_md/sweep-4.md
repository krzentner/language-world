    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab cube with gripper  3. Line up the cube with the goal  4. Slide cube sideways to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the cube is too far away, move the gripper until it's near the cube and then grab it.
    - When the cube is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should grab cube.
    As long as the gripper is still around the cube and the cube is not lined up with the goal, line up the cube with the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not horizontally aligned with the goal, the robot should align cube to goal.
    If the cube is lined up with the goal, slide it towards the goal.
    - When the cube is horizontally aligned with the goal, the robot should slide cube sideways towards goal.
