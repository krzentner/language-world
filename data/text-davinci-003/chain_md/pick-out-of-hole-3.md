    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper around the peg  3. Pull the peg out of the hole  4. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should put gripper above hole.
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    If the gripper is around the peg, we can try to pull it out.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg, the robot should pull peg out of the hole.
    Once we've successfully gotten the peg out of the hole, we can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move peg to goal.
