    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Spin the gripper around the handle  3. Pull the handle up
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can spin it around and pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    If the handle has moved under the gripper, we need to spin it around the handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above handle and the handle is below the gripper, the robot should spin gripper around handle.
    After we grab the handle with the gripper, we should be able to pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should pull up handle.
