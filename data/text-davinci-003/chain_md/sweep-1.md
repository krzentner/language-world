    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the cube sideways to the goal. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube sideways to goal.
