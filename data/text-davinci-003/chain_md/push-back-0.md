Steps:  1. Put gripper below puck  2. Push gripper into bottom of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    To slide the puck backwards, the robot should start from below the puck as opposed to above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper below the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper up to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
