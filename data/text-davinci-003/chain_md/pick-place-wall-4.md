Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move the puck to the target location, keeping in mind that the wall is in the way  5. Slide the puck sideways around the wall  6. Adjust the puck in its final position

If the gripper is not above the puck, move the gripper above it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
If the gripper is near the puck and open, grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
Now that we have the puck and the wall is in the way, move the puck to the goal and try to avoid the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed and the target is blocked by wall, the robot should slide puck around wall.
Finally, adjust the puck in its final position.
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and wall is clear, the robot should adjust puck in final position.
