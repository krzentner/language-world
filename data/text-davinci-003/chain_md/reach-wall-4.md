The steps the robot should perform are:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper above target  2. Align gripper with wall  3. Slide gripper around wall  4. Move gripper to target
    First, the robot should move its gripper toward the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target, the robot should move its gripper above the target.
    Once the robot's gripper is near the target, align it with the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the wall, the robot should align gripper with wall.
    Now the robot can slide its gripper around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not to the other side of wall, the robot should slide gripper around wall.
    Finally the robot can reach to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the other side of wall and gripper is not above target, the robot should move gripper to target.
