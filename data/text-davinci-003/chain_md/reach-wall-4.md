    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wall  2. Push gripper laterally against the wall  3. Reach over the wall to the target
    The wall is too high and wide for the robot to just reach over it, so we need to get the robot to push up against it's lateral side to create a gap. Put the gripper above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall, the robot should put gripper above wall.
    Now move the gripper against the wall to create the gap.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wall, the robot should push the gripper laterally against the wall.
    The gap should be wide enough for the robot to reach over it, so try reaching for the target. 
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing against the wall, the robot should reach over the wall to target.
