    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of dial  2. Rotate dial in a circular fashion  3. Check to see if the door locked
    If the dial is a bit higher than the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper to the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial and the dial is higher than the robot's gripper, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    Once the gripper is placed on top of the dial, rotate it in a circular fashion to start turning the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the dial is not rotating, the robot should rotate dial.
    If the dial is rotating, we might have already unlocked the door, so move the robot towards the door handle and check.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the dial is rotating, the robot should check if the door is locked.
