    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck and close gripper  3. Move gripper to target location 4. Release puck at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the puck, close the gripper to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should grab the puck.
    Now that the puck is in the gripper, move the gripper towards the target location.
    - When the robot has grabbed the puck and the puck is not at the target location, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location.
    If the puck is close to its target location, release the puck.
    - When the puck is near the target location, the robot should release the puck.
