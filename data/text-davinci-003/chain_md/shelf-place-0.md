    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Grab block with gripper  3. Move block to target location  4. Release block and leave it at target location
    First, put the gripper above the block so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should move the gripper above the block.
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around block.
    Once we've grabbed the block, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the block, the robot should move block to target location.
    When we reach the target location, open the gripper and leave the block at the target location.
    - When block is near the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should release block and leave it at target location.
