    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Move wall to side with gripper  3. Push gripper into top of puck  4. Slide puck to goal
    We need to move the wall to the side first if it's blocking the puck from being pushed.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall and the wall is blocking path to the puck, the robot should move gripper above wall.
    Line up the gripper above the wall and then move it down to the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wall, the robot should slide wall out of way.
    Once the wall is out of the way, move the gripper above the puck, as described in the `push` task.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    From then on the `push` task should be followed. When the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
