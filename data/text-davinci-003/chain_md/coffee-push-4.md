    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Grab mug handle with gripper  3. Move mug to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle, so that we don't bump the mug while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle.
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can move the mug to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the mug is not near the goal, the robot should move mug to goal.
