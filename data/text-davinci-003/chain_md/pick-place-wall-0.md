Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Drop gripper around the puck  3. Close gripper around the puck  4. Move the puck to the bottom of the wall  5. Lift the puck above the wall  6. Move the puck to the goal
    We need to put the gripper above the puck to grab in the same way as above. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck, we can close the gripper around it to pick it up. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    Now that the puck is in our possession, we need to move it to the bottom of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to bottom of wall.
    After the puck is at the bottom of the wall, we can lift it up and over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall and puck is at bottom of wall, the robot should lift puck above wall.
    Finally, we can move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall and puck is above wall, the robot should place puck at goal.
