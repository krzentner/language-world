    Now the gripper is over the wall, in front of the puck. Push the puck against the wall, towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of puck and the robot's gripper is above wall, the robot should push puck to goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is in front of puck and the puck is behind wall, the robot should grab puck.
