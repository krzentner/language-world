    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Rotate the lever up  3. Pull the lever up
    First, put the robot's gripper above the lever so that we can twist it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    If the gripper is lined up with the lever, we can rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and lever is not rotated up, the robot should rotate lever up.
    If the lever is partially up, keep going up and lift.
    - When lever is partially up, the robot should pull lever up.
