    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the puck  2. Start pushing against the puck  3. Push the puck towards the target location
    We need to put the gripper near the puck, so that the robot can start pushing against the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should move gripper near puck.
    If the robot is able to push against the puck, we can start pushing it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck, the robot should push puck towards target location.
    If the robot is pushing too slowly, push harder.
    - When the pushing force towards the target location is not enough, the robot should push puck towards target location more strongly.
