    We should grab the stick before we can use it to push the thermos. When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, we should put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    Once the stick is in the gripper, bring it close to the thermos.
    - When stick is not near thermos, the robot should move stick near thermos.
    Since the grip around the stick is weak, we should keep pushing on the thermos with the stick and make sure that it doesn't move away as we move it. 
    - When stick is near thermos and thermos is to the right of the stick, the robot should push thermos right.
    When the thermos is close to the goal, and it's not moving, push harder.
    - When stick is near thermos and thermos is almost at goal, the robot should push thermos harder.
