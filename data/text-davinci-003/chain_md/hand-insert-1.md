    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move to the goal.
    Now that the robot is at the target location, we can insert the puck into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the goal and the puck is not in the hole, the robot should insert puck into hole.
