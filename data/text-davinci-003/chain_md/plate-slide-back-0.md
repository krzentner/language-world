Steps:  1. Put gripper near front of plate  2. Push gripper into plate  3. Slide plate backward 
    We need to push the plate backward, so put the gripper near the front of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near front of plate, the robot should put gripper near front of plate.
    Now that we have the gripper in place near the front of the plate, we can push the gripper into the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not inside plate and the robot's gripper is not pushing against plate, the robot should push gripper into plate.
    Once we have the gripper pushing against the plate, we will be able to slide it backward as we move the gripper backward.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside plate, the robot should slide plate backward.
