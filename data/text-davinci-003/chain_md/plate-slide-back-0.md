    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push gripper into the top of the plate  3. Slide the plate back
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, move the gripper down to the plate.
