    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Trap plate with gripper  3. Slide plate to goal
    First, place the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    As long as the gripper is aligned with the plate and not near it, trapping the plate should be possible by pushing down on top.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, the robot should trap plate with gripper.
    If we can trap the plate with the gripper, we can slide it sideways to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate, the robot should slide plate to goal.
