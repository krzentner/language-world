    First, we should move the gripper close enough to the mug handle so that it can be grabbed.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.

    - When the robot's gripper is above mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle.
    After the mug handle is trapped in the gripper, we can lift it up and begin moving it towards the target location.
