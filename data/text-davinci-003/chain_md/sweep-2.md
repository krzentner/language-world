    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the cube sideways to the goal. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube sideways to goal.
