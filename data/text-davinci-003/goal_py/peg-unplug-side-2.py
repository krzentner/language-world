    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.

    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.

    # up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, pull it out.
