    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate
    #  3. Slide the plate back
    #  4. Release the plate
    # First, put the robot's gripper above the plate, so that the robot can grab
    # the plate without accidentally pushing it back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # Now that the robot's gripper is above the plate, it can try to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the plate is near the plate and closed, the plate should be grabbed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
    # Once the plate is near the target location, the robot can release it.
    if check("the plate is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
