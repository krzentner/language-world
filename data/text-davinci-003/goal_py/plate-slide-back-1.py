    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Slide the plate back
    # First, put the gripper left of the plate. This will make sure the robot
    # has a good grip on the plate.

        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the plate")
    # If the gripper is forward aligned with the plate, move it vertically
    # aligned with the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is below the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the plate and in front of it, slide the
    # plate back towards the goal.
    # Close the gripper to make sure the robot has a good grip on the plate.
