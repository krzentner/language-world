    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole
    #  2. Drop gripper into hole
    #  3. Close the gripper around the peg
    #  4. Remove the peg from the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    # Once the gripper is above the hole, drop it into the hole to grab the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper into hole")
    # Close the gripper around the peg if it is near the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around the peg")
    # Once the gripper is closed around the peg, we can try to remove the peg
    # from the hole.
    # If the peg is still in the hole, we can just move the peg up out of the
    # hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the peg and the peg is still in the hole"):
        robot.pull("peg up out of the hole")
