    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Grab cube  4. Move the cube to its target bin
    We need to put the gripper above the cube before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the gripper is lined up above the cube, we should be able to grab the cube by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can just move it to its target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
