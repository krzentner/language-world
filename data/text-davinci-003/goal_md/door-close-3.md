    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the door handle  2. Start pushing against the door handle to close the door  3. Push the door closed harder
    We need to put the gripper near the door handle before we can push it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the door handle
    If the door handle is left of the robot's gripper, we can start pushing the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle and the robot's gripper is right of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    Once the robot's gripper is near the door handle, push the door closed until it's near the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the door handle and the robot's gripper is near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
