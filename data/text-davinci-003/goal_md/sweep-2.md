    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
    If the cube becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the cube. Because the cube is a small object, make sure the gripper is lined up around the cube.
    - When the cube is not left of the robot's gripper and the cube is not around the robot's gripper, move  the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the cube is still around the gripper, we can maneuver the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sideways aligned with the target location
