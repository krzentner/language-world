    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to the target location
    First, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper is not around the cube, the robot needs to move the gripper around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the cube, the robot can start moving the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
