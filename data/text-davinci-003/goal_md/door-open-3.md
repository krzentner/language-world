 Steps:  1. Put gripper near the door handle  2. Pull the door open 
    Put the gripper near the door handle. We know we should pull the door open, so the robot should be horizontally aligned with the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, it should be automatically aligned horizontally with the door handle. 
    If it is not, adjust the robot's gripper until it is horizontally aligned with the door handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle
    We can now pull the door open by pulling the robot's gripper away from the door handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper away from the door handle to open the door.
