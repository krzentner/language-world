    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the plate  2. Push the plate sideways  3. Move the plate back into target location
    Put the gripper left of the plate before we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate
    Now, we can start pushing the plate back to the left.
    - When the plate is right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the plate
    As long as the robot's gripper is in front of the plate, we can push it back into the target location.
    - When the plate is not left of the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
