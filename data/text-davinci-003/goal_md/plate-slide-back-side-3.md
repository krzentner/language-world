    Steps:  1. Put gripper across the plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Slide the plate back until it is in the target location
    First, put the gripper across the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate but not across it, we can push the plate back by pushing against its side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not across plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is across the plate
    Now that the plate is aligned, we can slide the plate back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is across plate and the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in the target location
