    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with gripper  3. Slide plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the plate is left/right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a large object, check if the gripper is aligned with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Keep the gripper closed and move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left/right of the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target
