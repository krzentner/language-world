    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Close gripper around mug handle  4. Pull mug towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle. We will need to be careful about the direction since the mug is small and we need to keep a firm grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    If the mug is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the mug handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle 
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the mug handle and the mug handle isn't lined up with the target location, we can close it to grab the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper has a hold of the mug handle, we can pull it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the mug handle and the mug handle is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
