    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the mug  2. Pull the mug towards the goal  3. Control the mug's rotation and lift
    First, we need to put the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug
    We can start to pull the mug towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    At this point, we need to control the rotation and lift of the mug, so it doesn't slide out of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the mug is not facing the target location, rotate the robot's gripper until the mug is facing the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the mug is not at the desired height, lift the robot's gripper until the mug is at the desired height
