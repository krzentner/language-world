    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube 3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move the cube to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube. We don't need to line it up too accurately as long as it's above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, we can probably grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
