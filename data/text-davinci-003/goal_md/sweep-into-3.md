    Steps:  1. Put gripper below cube  2. Lift the cube  3. Slide cube to the target location 
    First, put the gripper below the cube so it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is below the cube and open, close it to keep the cube in it's grasp.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the cube is in the gripper, lift it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Once the robot's gripper is near the target location, the goal is to slide the cube to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the cube is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the cube is above the target location
