    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck around wall 4. Slide puck to goal
    We need to move the gripper above the puck so we can trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    The wall will be in the way, so we should trap the puck with the forcible motion of pushing the gripper into the top of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertical aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is pushing into the top of the puck
    To push the puck around the wall, the robot should move its gripper slightly over the wall, and then slide it around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is pushing into the top of the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wall
    When the puck is on the other side of the wall, we can follow the wall to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wall and puck is on the other side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
