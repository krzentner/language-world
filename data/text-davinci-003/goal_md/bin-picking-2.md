    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to bin  5. Drop cube in bin
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin
    If the gripper is near the bin, lower the gripper down and release the cube by opening the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is open
