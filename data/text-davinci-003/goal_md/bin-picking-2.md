    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper noted from the top. 2. Place the gripper under the cube. 3. Place the cube into the bin.
    First, line up the robot's gripper as viewed from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can lower the gripper down to the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with cube and the robot's gripper is not below cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the cube
    After the gripper is below the cube, open the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is below cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    With the cube in the gripper, move the gripper above the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin
