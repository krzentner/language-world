    Steps:  1. Put the wrench in front of the peg  2. Angle the wrench so that it is perpendicular to the peg  3. Slide the wrench around the peg
    First, put the robot's gripper in front of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the peg
    Then, angle the wrench so that it is perpendicular to the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at an angle so the the wrench is perpendicular to the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.
    Then, slide the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is angled and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
