    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Move gripper onto lever  3. Grip lever and pull upward
    First, put the gripper above the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever
    Once the gripper is lined up above the lever, we should be able to grab the lever by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever
    Once the gripper is around the lever, we can just grip the lever and pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the lever
