    We need to put the gripper left of the peg before we can grab it, since the peg will have to start moving sideways to be taken out.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost left of the peg and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost left of the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    We've got the gripper left of the peg, so just grab the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the peg becomes forward aligned to the gripper, move the peg sideways out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not out of the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is out of the hole
