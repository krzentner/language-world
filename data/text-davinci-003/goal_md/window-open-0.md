    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the window handle is left of the robot's gripper, we need to move the gripper left of the window handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    Once the robot's gripper is right of the window handle, we should be able to slide the window open by pushing the gripper left.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the gripper is starting to be above the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
