    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial 2. Move gripper down around the dial  3. Rotate the dial to the appropriate direction
    First, put the gripper above the dial, so that we don't slip off of it.

    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
    If the dial isn't below the gripper, move the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the dial, we can rotate it to the appropriate direction
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is rotated to the appropriate direction
