Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Drop gripper around dial  3. Rotate dial to unlock the door
    We need to put the gripper above the dial before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
    Once the gripper is above the dial, we should be able to grab the dial by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, rotate the dial to unlock the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, move the robot's gripper until the dial is unlocked
