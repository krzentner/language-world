    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Line up the hoop with the ball  4. Throw the ball into the hoop 

First, the robot should put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball
    Once the gripper is lined up with the ball, the robot can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball and the robot's gripper is not near the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is nearest to the ball and open, we should be able to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the hoop is forward aligned with the ball
    Once the hoop is aligned with the ball, we can throw it.
    - When the hoop is forward aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper in an upward motion, releasing the ball at the desired angle and velocity
