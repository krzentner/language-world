     Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Close gripper around mug handle  4. Move mug to target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the mug handle, we should be able to grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can just move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
