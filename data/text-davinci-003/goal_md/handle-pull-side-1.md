    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Dropping gripper around handle  3. Pull the handle up  4. Push the handle up
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the handle is left of the gripper, we have to move the gripper until it's forward aligned with the handle.
    - When handle is not left of the robot's gripper and handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, go back to putting the gripper above the handle.
    - When handle is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
