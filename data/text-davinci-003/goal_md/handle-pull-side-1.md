    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the handle  2. Grab onto the handle  3. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once we're sure the gripper is aligned with the handle, it's safe to put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is below the handle and closed, we should be able to grab onto the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and move the robot's gripper up
