    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to bin  5. Move gripper away from bin
    First, put the gripper above cube in order to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper is not around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and closed, it should be able to pick up the cube just by moving away.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the bin
    Now move the cube to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the bin, move the robot's gripper until cube is in bin
    Once the cube is in the bin, the robot can remove the gripper away from the bin.
    - When cube is in bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from bin
