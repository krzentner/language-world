    Steps:  1. Put gripper forward of the button  2. Align the robot's gripper with the button  3. Push the button
    First, put the gripper in front of the button so we know where to push.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button
    If the button is on the left or right of the robot's gripper, we need to align it.
    - When robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with button and robot's gripper is not above button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button
    If the button is directly in front of the robot's gripper, just push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
