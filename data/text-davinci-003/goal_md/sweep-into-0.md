 
Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Push the cube into the target location 

First put the gripper in front of the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is not in front of the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the cube

If the gripper isn't around the cube yet, put it around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed

Once the gripper is around the cube we can probably push the cube into the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the cube is in the target location 

If the cube is close to being in the target location, push it in harder. 
- When the cube is close to being in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the cube is in the target location
