    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Move block to goal
    Start by putting the gripper above the block, so that it can gently grab the object without bumping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    Once the gripper is slightly above the block, we can move into the block to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is not around the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block, we can probably grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
