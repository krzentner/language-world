Steps:  1. Put gripper left of plate  2. Move plate towards target location  3. Verify plate is in target location
For this task, we have something to manipulate, so we can slide the plate into the target location. To do this, start by putting the gripper left of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not left of plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
Once the gripper is near the plate, push the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate is still a distance away from the target position, move the robot's gripper until the plate is closer to the target position
When the plate is close to the target position, check that it is actually in the target position.
- When the plate is near the target position, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the target position and the robot's gripper is closed
