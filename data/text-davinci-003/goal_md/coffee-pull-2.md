    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Pull mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle, so that we don't knock over the mug while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle
    If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, pull the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
