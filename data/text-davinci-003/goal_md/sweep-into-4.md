    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
    Once the gripper is lined up above the cube, we should be able to grab the cube by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the cube is grabbed, if the cube isn't at the target location, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
