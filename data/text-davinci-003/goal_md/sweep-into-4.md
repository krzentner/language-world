Steps: 1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to goal
    The steps to move the cube to the target location is similar to the pick-place task, but with the addition of the sweeping step. We still need the initial steps of putting the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the cube is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper gets close to the cube, the robot may still need to adjust the position. At this point the robot should begin sweeping the cube until it is aligned with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube, move the robot's gripper until the cube is forward aligned with the target location
