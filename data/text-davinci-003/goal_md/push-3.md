    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the puck  2. Start pushing against the puck  3. Push the puck to target location
    If the robot's gripper is not left of the puck, we should move the gripper near the puck to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the puck
    If the robot's gripper is near the puck we can probably slide the puck to the target location by moving the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
