Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of faucet handle  2. Turn the faucet handle right  3. Increase pressure to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle so that it doesn't slip when turning.

    Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, turn the handle right.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    If the gripper is around the handle, apply force to turn it and make sure it is turning round.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed and the faucet handle is turned right
