    Steps:  1. Put gripper near handle  2. Pull up the handle
    We can move the gripper near the handle by looking at the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the handle
    When the gripper is near the handle, start pulling it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the handle is above the robot's gripper
