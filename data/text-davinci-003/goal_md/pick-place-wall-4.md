    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move the puck along the wall to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is against the wall
    Now, move the puck along the wall and to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is against the wall and the puck is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
