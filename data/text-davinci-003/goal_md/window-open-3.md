    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pulling against the window handle to open the window  3. Pull the window open harder
    First, put the gripper right of the window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the window handle, start pulling the window open.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, pull harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
