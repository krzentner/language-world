    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Sweep cube to the target location
    We should be able the grab the cube without having to move it first, so put the gripper to the left of the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with cube and the robot's gripper is not left of cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is left of cube.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is now around the cube, we can start to sweep it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
