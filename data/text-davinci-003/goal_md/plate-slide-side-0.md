    Steps:  1. Put gripper near plate  2. Lift plate with gripper  3. Move plate to goal
    First, put the gripper near the plate left to right.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate and the plate is not below the robot's gripper, we can lift the plate by pressing down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the plate is not below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the plate is below the robot's gripper, we can slide the plate sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
