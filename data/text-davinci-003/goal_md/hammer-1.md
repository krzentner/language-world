    Steps:  1. Line up the robot's gripper above the nail  2. Drop the hammer's head around the nail  3. Hit the nail with the hammer head.
    We need to line the robot's gripper up with the nail first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above or vertical aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the nail and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the robot's gripper is above the nail, drop the hammer's head around the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail and the hammer head is not around the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer head is around the nail
    Now that the hammer is around the nail, the robot can hit the nail with the hammer head.
    - When the hammer head is around the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail and the robot's gripper is half opened
