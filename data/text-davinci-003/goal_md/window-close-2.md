    Steps: 1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window close harder
    Just like opening the window, the robot should first move the gripper near the window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can start pushing it to the right to close the window.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle, we can slide the window closed by moving the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle
