    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of door handle  2. Grab dial with gripper  3. Rotate dial to desired orientation 
    First, move the gripper to the right of the door handle so we can grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the door handle 
    Once we have moved the gripper to the right of the handle, line up the gripper with the dial so we can grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is forward aligned with the dial and the gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up, grab the dial with the gripper and rotate it to the desired orientation.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the dial is pointing in the desired direction
