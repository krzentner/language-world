    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle 2. Start pushing against the window handle to open it 3. Push the window open harder
    We need to put the gripper right of the window handle before we can open it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably open the window now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the window handle
