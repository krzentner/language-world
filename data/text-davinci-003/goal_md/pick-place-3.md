    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck  3. Line the puck up with the target location  4. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the puck is left of the gripper, we should go back to putting the gripper above the puck. Because the puck is a small object, check if the gripper is completely around it instead of lined up in front.
    - When the puck is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now we can line up the puck and target location.
    - When the puck is horizontally aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    If the puck is lined up with the target location to the side, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the puck and the puck is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
