    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the handle  2. Line up gripper with handle  3. Push down on the handle
    We need to put the gripper on the side of the handle in order to be able to push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the handle 
    Once the gripper is close to the side of the handle, we need to get it straight by moving it forward.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the handle and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle
    Now that the gripper is aligned with the handle, push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
