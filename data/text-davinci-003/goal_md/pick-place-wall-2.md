Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Drop gripper around the puck  3. Close gripper around the puck  4. Push the puck against the wall with the gripper  5. Slide the puck to the target location while pushing against wall
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is near the puck and it's closed, we can push the puck against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing the puck against the wall
    Once the puck is against the wall we can start to slide it to the target location. 
    - When the puck is against the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
