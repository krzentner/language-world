    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Push the thermos with the stick  4. Drop the stick  
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
    If the stick has moved left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick. Because the stick is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When stick is not left of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the stick is trapped by the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, we can push the thermos with the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the thermos reaches the target location
    Now that the thermos is at the target location, we should drop the stick.
    - When the thermos is at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
