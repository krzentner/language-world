    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck sideways until it bumps into wall  4. Make small adjustments to make the puck go around the wall  5. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. Move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck and trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now slide the puck sideways until it bumps into the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall
    If the puck is near the wall, move the gripper ever so slightly away from the wall to guide the puck around the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the puck is close to the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
