    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
