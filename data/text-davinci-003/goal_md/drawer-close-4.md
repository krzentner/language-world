    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Push the drawer closed
    Before we can start pushing the drawer closed, we need to put the gripper firmly around the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can start pushing the drawer closed. When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is ahead of the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle
