    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever  2. Drop gripper around the lever  3. Pull up on the lever with gripper
    We need to put the gripper above the lever before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever
    Once the gripper is lined up above the lever, we should be able to grab the lever by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is not around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever
    Once the gripper is around the lever, we can just pull the lever up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the lever
