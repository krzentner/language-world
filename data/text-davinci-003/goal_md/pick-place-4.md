    Steps:  1. Place gripper above puck  2. Grab puck with gripper  3. Move puck to target location  4. Drop puck at target location
    The robot should first place the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    As long as the robot's gripper is lined up with the puck, we can grab the puck by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot has the puck, we can move it to the target location. 
    - When the puck is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Finally, we can drop the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is nearby the target location and the robot's gripper is open
