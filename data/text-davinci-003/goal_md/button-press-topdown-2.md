Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Push the button down  3. Move the gripper away from the button
    First, let's put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    If the button isn't below the gripper, we need to move the gripper above it.
    - When button is not below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    If the gripper is lined up with the button, the robot can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper downward until the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is near the button and the gripper is closed, the button can be pushed. Once the button is pushed down, let go of it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from the button
