    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate 2. Drop gripper around the plate 3. Slide the plate back and to the side until it is in the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is above the plate, align the gripper around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    Lastly, slide the plate back and to the side until it is in the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location
