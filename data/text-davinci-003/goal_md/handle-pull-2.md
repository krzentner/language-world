    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Start pulling the handle up  3. Pull the handle up harder
    We should start by putting the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can start pulling the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is completely around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is completely around the handle, we can pull it up harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
