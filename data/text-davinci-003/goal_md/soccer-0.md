Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball  3. Push soccer ball to the goal 
First, put the gripper above the soccer ball. 
-When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball 
Once the gripper is above the soccer ball, push it down onto the soccer ball. 
-When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not close to soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed 
If the gripper is close to the soccer ball, we can probably push it to the goal now by moving the gripper in the direction of the goal. 
-When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
