    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball  3. Slide soccer ball to goal
    The robot should first position the gripper such that the gripper is above the soccer ball, as seen from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper is in the correct position above the soccer ball, the robot can then push down on the soccer ball, trapping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Moving the gripper will then slide the soccer ball to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
