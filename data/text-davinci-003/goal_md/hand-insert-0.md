    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper above puck, as viewed from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the robot's gripper is lined up, put the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
