    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Drop gripper around lever  3. Rotate the lever up
    First, put the gripper above the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever
    Now that the gripper is lined up above the lever, lets move the gripper around the lever so we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is not around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever
    If the gripper is around the lever, we can rotate the lever by moving the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the lever is rotated up
