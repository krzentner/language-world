    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Drop gripper on the side of the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Move the peg towards the goal  5. Push the peg into the goal
    We need to put the gripper roughly above the peg and around the side before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above peg and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg
    If the gripper is aligned with the peg but not near it, move the gripper down to the peg to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not near peg, move the robot's gripper until robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the peg we can move it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the peg is above the goal
    When the peg is above the goal, push the peg into the hole with the gripper.
    - When the peg is above the goal, move the robot's gripper until the peg is inserted into the goal
