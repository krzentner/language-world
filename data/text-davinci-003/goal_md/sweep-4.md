    Steps:  1. Put gripper just above the cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to the target  
    First, put the gripper just above the cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not just above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is just above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now if the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the cube, we can move it sideways to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
