Steps: 1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Close gripper around stick  4. Move gripper apart from thermos (keeping stick between gripper and thermos)  5. Move gripper in direction of target location relative to thermos  6. Pull thermos to target location while keeping stick between gripper and thermos.

First, put the gripper above the stick, so that we don't bump the thermos while trying to grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the stick and open, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above stick and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper apart from the thermos (keeping stick between gripper and thermos)

Once the gripper is around the stick and far away from the thermos, we need to move the gripper in the direction of the target location relative to the thermos. 
- When the robot's gripper is apart from the thermos and the stick, move the robot's gripper in the direction of the target location relative to the thermos, in order to tug the thermos towards the target location
Finally, pull the thermos to the target location while maintaining the stick between the gripper and thermos, so that we can control the thermos.
- When robot's gripper is facing in the direction of the target location relative to the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near target location
