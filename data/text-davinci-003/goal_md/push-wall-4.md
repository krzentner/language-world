    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck toward wall  4. Push puck around the wall  5. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck

    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed

    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it toward the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall and the puck is in front of the wall

    Once the puck is in front of the wall, push the puck around the wall by pushing it in the direction of the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the puck is forward aligned with the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
