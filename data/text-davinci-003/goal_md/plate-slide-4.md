    Steps:  1. Put gripper near top of the plate  2. Grip the plate  3. Push the plate toward the target location
    To slide the plate, first the robot should position the gripper near the top of the plate so that the plate will slide more easily.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate
    If the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate, we can now grip the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is closed around the plate, the robot can start pushing the plate toward the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
