    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the door handle  2. Push the door closed  3. Drop gripper slightly below the door handle
    Put the robot's gripper near the door handle, so that we can start pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the door handle, push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the door is not completely closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing the door closed
    Finally, if the door is closed, drop the gripper slightly below the door handle. This will act as an extra lock to make sure the door stays closed
    - When the door is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is slightly below the door handle
