    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into the top of puck  3. Slide puck along wall to the target location
    First, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it along the wall. Press the wall with the gripper in order to keep the puck in contact and move it to the target location.
    - When the wall is pressed by the robot's gripper and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
