Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper down onto plate  3. Move plate back sideways to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is lined up from the top, but not close to the plate, move the gripper down to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it backwards and sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
