    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Drop gripper above the plate  3. Push back the plate  4. Slide the plate back
    First, we need to put the gripper above the plate so that we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not near the plate, we should reach for it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    Once the gripper is in the correct position and when the plate is forward aligned with the gripper, we can start pushing the plate back.
    - When the plate is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in front of the robot's gripper
    If the plate is not sliding back into the target location, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not back aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is back aligned with the target location
