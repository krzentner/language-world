    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push the handle down
    First, we need to put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can move it down and around the handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can just push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle
