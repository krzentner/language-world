    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Drop gripper around the box lid  3. Close gripper around the box lid  4. Place the box lid on the box
    First, put the gripper above the box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the box lid, close the gripper to make sure we keep control of it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until it is above the box and then lower it until the box lid is resting in its slot.
