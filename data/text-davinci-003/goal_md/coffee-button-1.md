    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Drop gripper around button  3. Push button
    We need to put the gripper above the button before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    If the button becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the button.
    - When button is not left of the robot's gripper and button is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is nearby, we can just push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
