    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the faucet handle  2. Start pushing against the faucet handle to open the faucet  3. Push the faucet open harder
    We should move the gripper to the left of the faucet handle before attempting to move it. If the gripper is not near the faucet handle, move it near the faucet handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle
    If the gripper is near the faucet handle, start pushing against it to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle
    If the faucet isn't opening, push harder.
