Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Align the plate with the target location  3. Push the plate into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the plate and the target are not aligned, we'll have to line them up before we can slide it in.
    - When the plate is not aligned with the target, move the robot's gripper until the plate is horizontally aligned with the target
    Once the plate is lined up, we can push it in to the target.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
