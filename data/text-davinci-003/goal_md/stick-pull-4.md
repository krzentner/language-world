     Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Close gripper around stick  4. Move the stick to the thermos  5. Open the gripper around the stick  6. Pull the thermos with the stick  7. Move the thermos to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.  
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above stick and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the thermos 
    Once the gripper is left of the thermos, open the gripper and use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the thermos and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the stick is near the thermos, use it to pull the thermos towards the target location.  
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the target location
