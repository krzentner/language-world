    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull handle up the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle. We don't need to be super precise here: if the gripper is mostly above the handle, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up and closed, the gripper should "lock" the handle, even if it's in the wrong orientation.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the handle
    After the gripper is left of the handle, we can pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
