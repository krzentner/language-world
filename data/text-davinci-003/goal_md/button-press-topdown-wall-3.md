    Steps:  1. Line up gripper to the wall  2. Push the gripper into the wall  3. Drop gripper around the button  4. Push down on the button from the top
    We need to adjust the gripper's movement so that it lines up with the button while pushing against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the wall
    If the gripper is in front of the wall, push it into the wall to make sure the two are aligned.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the wall and the robot's gripper is not around the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the button
    Now that the gripper is around the button, we can push down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
