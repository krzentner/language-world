    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper around the peg in the hole  3. Pull the peg out of the hole  4. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole 
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and peg is not within the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot's gripper is above the peg, we can start pulling the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pulling the peg above the surface of the hole
    When the peg is out of the hole, move the robot's gripper towards the target location.
    - When the peg is out of the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
