    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Move block to goal
    First, put the gripper above the block so that when we lower it we don't push it away.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block
    If the gripper isn't bulky enough to surround the block, lower the gripper until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block and the robot's gripper is not around block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the block, we can lift it up and move it to the shelf.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
