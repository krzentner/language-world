First, put the gripper mostly above the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Now that the gripper is lined up, make sure the gripper is around the handle before pulling it.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
If the gripper is around the faucet handle, pull the faucet handle to the left.
- When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the counterclockwise rotation direction relative to the initial position of the faucet handle
