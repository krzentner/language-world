    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the edge of the plate  2. Push the edge of the plate back  3. Push the plate all the way back
    First, put the gripper above the edge of the plate to avoid any collision with the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above plate's edge, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above plate's edge
    If the plate is not close to the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper closer to the plate until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate's edge and the robot's gripper is not close to the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the plate
    To slide the plate back, we can just push it from behind.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the plate
    To make sure that the plate goes all the way back, push all the way back.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is near the target location
