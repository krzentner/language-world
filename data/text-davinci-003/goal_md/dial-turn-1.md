    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the dial  2. Rotate the dial
    To turn the dial reliably, the robot should first move the gripper around the edge of the dial so that the gripper is in contact with it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Then the robot can rotate the dial clockwise or counterclockwise to the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the desired position of the dial is reached
