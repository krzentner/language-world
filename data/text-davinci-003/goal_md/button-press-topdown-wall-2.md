    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side so that it is above the wall  2. Drop gripper to the side so that it is in front of the button  3. Push down on button until it is pushed to the bottom  4. Move gripper to the side so that it is above the button again
    The short wall may get in the way so we want to put the gripper to the side so that it's above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall and the robot's gripper is not right of wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of wall and the robot's gripper is above wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, if the button isn't already in front of the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper until it's in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not in front of button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of button and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the button is in front of the gripper, we can push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button.
