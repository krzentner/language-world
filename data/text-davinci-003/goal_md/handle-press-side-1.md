    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the handle from the side  2. Push down on the handle
    Because this is a side-press, we should line up the robot's gripper from the side. Move the robot's gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    To keep the gripper in place, close it to make sure it's lined up with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle 
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
