    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of lid  2. Pick up lid  3. Place lid on top of box
    First, put the gripper on top of the lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lid
    If the lid is still there, we can pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is around the lid, we can move it and place it on top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the box and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
