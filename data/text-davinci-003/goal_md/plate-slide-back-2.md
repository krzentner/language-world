    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of plate 2. Grip plate with gripper 3. Move gripper backwards to slide plate   
    First, put the gripper near the plate. We don't need to be exact, since the robot is pushing against this object.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate we can grip it by reaching the gripper over it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not over the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is over the plate
    If the plate is held by the gripper and the plate is not near the target, slide the plate back to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is over the plate and the plate is not near the target, move the robot's gripper backwards until the robot's gripper is near the target location
