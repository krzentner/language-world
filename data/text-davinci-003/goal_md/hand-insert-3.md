    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Grip around puck  4. Lift puck  5. Move puck to target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck before we can pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, drop the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can pick it up by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move robot's gripper upwards to lift the puck
    If the puck is lifted, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
