    The first step is to put the gripper above the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the basketball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the basketball
    Now that the gripper is in place, grab the basketball with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the basketball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the basketball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the basketball is in the robot's grasp, line up the basketball with the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the basketball and basketball is not horizontally aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hoop
    Once the basketball is lined up with the hoop, we just push and release the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hoop and the robot's gripper is open
