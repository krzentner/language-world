    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wall  2. Push wall out of the way  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wall
    From here, the robot can push against the wall to slide the wall out of the way.
    - When the wall is in the way of the puck and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in contact with the wall and the robot is trying to push the wall out of the way
    After the wall is out of the way, the robot can manipulate the puck as normal to get it to the target location.
    - When the wall is out of the way, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck
