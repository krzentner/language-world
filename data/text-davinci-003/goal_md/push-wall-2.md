    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck and left of wall  2. Push gripper into the side of the puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    Since the wall is in the way, the gripper needs to be left of the wall and above the puck. Move the gripper until it is left of the wall.
    - When wall is right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the wall is left of the robot's gripper
    If the gripper is left of the wall, we can slide the puck just like we did before, by trapping it and moving the gripper.
    - When the wall is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not right of the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the puck and move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is near the puck, we can slide the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
