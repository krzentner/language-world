    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Put wrench around peg  4. Tighten wrench around peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the wrench becomes in front of the robot's gripper, go back to putting the robot's gripper above the wrench. Because the wrench is a long object, check if the robot's gripper is lined up with it horizontally instead of around it.
    - When the wrench is not in front of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the wrench is forward aligned with the robot's gripper, we can put the wrench around the peg.
    - When the wrench is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, if the wrench is around the peg, we can tighten it.
    - When the wrench is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg
