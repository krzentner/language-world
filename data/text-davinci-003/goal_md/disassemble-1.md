Steps:  1. Put gripper around wrench  2. Pull the wrench off the peg 
First, put the gripper around the wrench so that it can grab it securely.
 - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is securely around the wrench, we should be able to pull the wrench off the peg. 
-When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.
