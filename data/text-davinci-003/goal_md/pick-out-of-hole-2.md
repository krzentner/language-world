    Steps:  1. Put closed gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper from the side  3. Pull out the peg  4. Move peg to the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper above the peg. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is above the peg, we can grab the peg with the gripper from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper cannot grab the peg, the robot needs to try to pull it out.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is ahead of the peg
    Once the peg is pulled out, it can be moved to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is ahead of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
