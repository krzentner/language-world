    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Pull peg up out of the hole  4. Close gripper around peg  5. Move peg to target location
    First, the robot should put the gripper above the peg, so that it's not in the way when grabbing the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, we should move it down there.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the peg, it could be stuck in the hole. We should pull it out in order to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg, move the robot's gripper until the peg is out of the hole
    Once the peg is visible, close the gripper around the peg to hold it, and then move the gripper to target location if necessary.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
