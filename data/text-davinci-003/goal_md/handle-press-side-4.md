    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the handle  2. Push down on the handle from the side  3. Move the handle down to its locked position
    If the handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper until it is near the handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is near the handle, start pushing on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    If the handle is aligned with the gripper, and the gripper is moving to push the handle, slowly move the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is pushing down on the handle
