    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push handle from side  4. Push handle down 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    If the gripper isn't opened around the handle, open it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open 
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can push it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sideways aligned with the handle
    After pushing the handle from the side, push the handle down until it clicks into place.
    - When the robot's gripper is sideways aligned with the handle and the handle is not pushed down, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pushed down
