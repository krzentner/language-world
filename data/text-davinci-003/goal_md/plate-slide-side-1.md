    Steps:  1. Put gripper next to the plate  2. Line up the plate with the target  3. Slide the plate sideways into target
    We need to put the gripper to the side of the plate before we start sliding it. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the plate is thin and we're just sliding it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate, we should make sure that the plate is lined up with the target before we start sliding.
    - When the plate is not horizontally aligned with target, move the robot's gripper until the plate is horizontally aligned with target
    If the plate is lined up, start to slide it in.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with target and the robot's gripper is not beside the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is adjacent to the plate
