    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    If the mug handle is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When mug handle is left of the robot's gripper and mug handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the mug handle, close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
