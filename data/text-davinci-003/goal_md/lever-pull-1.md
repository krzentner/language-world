    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Grab lever with gripper  3. Rotate lever up
    We need to ensure that the gripper is lined up with the lever above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just grab the lever by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    We need to be extra careful that the gripper is not directly over the lever, so close the gripper to ensure that it's actually gripping.
    - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is opposing the lever
    If the gripper is opposing the lever, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is opposing the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is rotated to the fully-up position
