    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Push closed the drawer
    First, put the gripper above the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just push the drawer close.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle
