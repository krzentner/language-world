Steps:  1. Put gripper on the side of the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Line the cube up with the target location  4. Sweep the cube sideways towards the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly on the side of the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the cube
    Once the gripper is aligned with the cube, close the gripper to get a better grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    We have now grabbed the cube and need to line it up with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the cube is aligned with the target location
    Once the cube is aligned with the target, move the gripper sideways towards the target location.
    - When the cube is aligned with the target location and the cube is right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
