    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the left or right of the wall  2. Drop down gripper around the puck  3. Close gripper around the puck  4. Slide puck along the wall to the target location
    We don't want to push the puck against the wall and make it go somewhere we didn't intend. We should put the gripper to the left or right of the wall before we pick up the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right or left of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right or left of the wall
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is opened, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, we can push the puck sideways along the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
