    Steps:  1. Put gripper above faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around faucet handle  3. Turn the faucet left
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle. This helps to ensure that the robot is lined up with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle
    Now that the gripper is lined up, we should drop it around the faucet handle to make sure we have a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, then we can turn the faucet left.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle
