    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Grab edge of wrench  3. Pull wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench to get friction.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wrench
    If the robot's gripper is above the wrench but not lined up, line up the robot's gripper with the wrench and and grip it tight.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper has a firm grip, we can pull it off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from the peg.
