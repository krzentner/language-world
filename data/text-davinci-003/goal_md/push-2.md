    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3.Push the puck towards the target
    Place the gripper above the puck, so that it doesn't accidentally bump into the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    When the gripper is above the puck, drop it around the puck to grasp it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the puck, we can push it towards the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the target position
