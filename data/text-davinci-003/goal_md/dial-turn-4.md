    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Grasp the dial with the gripper  3. Push the dial in the desired direction
    First, put the gripper above the dial. We want to make sure the gripper aligns from top down so the we don't miss the dial or accidentally push it in the wrong direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Then, grasp the dial firmly with the gripper, so we can push it in the desired direction without it slipping out of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Lastly, push the dial in the desired direction until the desired result is achieved.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the desired direction
