    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Push the wrench down off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the wrench is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the wrench. Check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the wrench, we can push the wrench down off the peg.
    - When the wrench is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushed down past the peg
