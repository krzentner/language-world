    Steps:  1. Line up the robot's wrist as viewed from the side  2. Place the robot's gripper slightly in front of the wall  3. Push the button from the top
   We need to first line up the robot's wrist from the side so its gripper can reach around the wall.
    - When the robot's wrist is not horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's wrist until the robot's wrist is horizontally aligned with the button
    We need to place the gripper slightly in front of the wall so its gripper can move around it.
    - When the wall is not in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the wall is in front of the robot's gripper
    The gripper should now be ready to push the button from the top. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
