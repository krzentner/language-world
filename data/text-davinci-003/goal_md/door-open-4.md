    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    We need to put the gripper above the door handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the door handle, we should be able to grab the door handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle
