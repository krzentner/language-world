    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg sideways from the hole
    To grab the peg, we need to put the gripper on left side of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the peg
    If the gripper isn't near the peg, move the gripper near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the peg and the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the grip is near the peg, we should be able to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the peg is not in the hole
