    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pulling against the window handle to open the window  3. Pull the window open harder
    First, put the gripper right of the window handle by moving it along the window until it's in the right position.
    - When the window handle is left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle 
    Now that the robot's gripper is right of the window handle, move the gripper down to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the window handle and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle 
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, pull harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the window handle
