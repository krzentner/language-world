    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Move plate sideways into target location
    The robot needs to line up the plate above the target location first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the plate is lined up, the robot can just slide it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is above the target location
