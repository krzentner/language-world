    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the hammer handle  2. Lower the gripper onto the hammer handle  3. Grab onto the handle  4. Move the gripper quickly towards the nail and then release the gripper to hit the nail
    First, we need to put the gripper above the hammer handle so we can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the hammer handle, move it down until it grabs it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot can grab the handle, we need to move it quickly towards the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the hammer handle and the hammer is not near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail
    If the nail is almost near the robot's gripper, let go of the gripper to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near nail and the hammer is not in contact with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is in contact with the nail
