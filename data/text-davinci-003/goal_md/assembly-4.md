    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Grab wrench with gripper  3. Wrap wrench around peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is above the wrench, the robot should be able to grab the wrench by dropping the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench
    Now that the gripper has the wrench, grip it and wrap it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is wrapped around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
