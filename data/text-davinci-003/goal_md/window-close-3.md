    Steps:  1. Put the gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the window handle
    Once the robot's gripper is near the window handle, we can start sliding the window closed by pushing the robot's gripper toward the right. 
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle
