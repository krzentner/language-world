    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of window handle  2. Start pushing against window handle to close window  3. Push window closed harder 
    First, move the robot's gripper left of the window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the window handle
    We should be able to start pushing against the window handle when the robot's gripper is near it.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
    Now we should be able to slide the window closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle
