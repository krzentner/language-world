    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Close gripper around handle 4. Move mug to goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    We need to move the gripper around the mug handle before we can pick it up, so line up the gripper with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle
    If the gripper is around the mug handle, we can hold it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug is in the gripper and the target location is in sight, the mug can be moved there.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
