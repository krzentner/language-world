    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lock  2. Drop gripper around lock  3. Turn the lock dial
    First, the robot should move the gripper to the lock.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lock, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lock
    Once the gripper is above the lock, we can move the gripper around it to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lock and the robot's gripper is not around lock, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lock and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now the robot can grab the lock with the gripper and turn the lock dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lock, move the robot's gripper until the lock dial is in the correct position
