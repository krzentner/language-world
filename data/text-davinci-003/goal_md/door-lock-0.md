    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Rotate the dial in the correct direction  4. Let go of the dial
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
   If the gripper is near the dial, we can use it to grab the dial and turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the dial is in the gripper, we can move it in the correct direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the robot's gripper is near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is rotating the dial in the correct direction 
    Once the dial is in the correct position, let go of the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is rotating the dial in the correct direction, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is open
