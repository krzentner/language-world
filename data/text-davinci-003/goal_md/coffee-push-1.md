    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Drop gripper around mug  3. Close gripper around mug  4. Push mug to target location 
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug
    If the mug isn't left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the mug. We can move the gripper down as needed without worrying about hitting the mug.
    - When mug is not left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the mug, check if the robot can push the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
