 
Steps: 
    1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the front  2. Push around the wall with the button from the front 
First, let's line up the gripper from the front, just in front of the short wall.
-When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
Now that the gripper is lined up, move around the wall with the button from the front.
-When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall
