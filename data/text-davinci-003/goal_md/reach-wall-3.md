    Steps:  1. Reach towards wall  2. Make sure the gripper is reaching above the wall  3. Reach around the wall to the target location
    We will need to clear the wall first, so start by reaching the gripper towards the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not reaching towards the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is reaching towards the wall
    When the gripper is reaching towards the wall, make sure the gripper is reaching above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not reaching above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is reaching above the wall
    If the wall is now above the gripper we can move it around the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wall and the robot's gripper is not reaching towards the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is reach towards the target location
