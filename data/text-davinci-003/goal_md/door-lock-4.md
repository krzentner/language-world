    Steps:  1. Put gripper near dial  2. Push the dial up  3. Turn the dial clockwise
    We need to put the gripper near the dial before we can turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is near the dial, push it up so that we can turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near dial and the dial is not up, move the robot's gripper until the dial is up
    If the dial is lined up, we can turn it clockwise.
    - When the dial is up, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is turned clockwise
