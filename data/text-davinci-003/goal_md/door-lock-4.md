    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Put gripper forward aligned with dial  3. Turn the dial clockwise  4. Turn the dial counter clockwise
    First, the robot's gripper needs to be above the dial and is closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    We need to get the gripper forward aligned with the dial so that it can turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the dial
    Now that the gripper is forward aligned, the robot can turn the dial by moving it clockwise and counter clockwise.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper to turn the dial clockwise and then counter clockwise
