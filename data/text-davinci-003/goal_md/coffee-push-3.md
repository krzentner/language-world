    Steps:  1. Align the gripper just above the mug  2. Drop the gripper around the mug  3. Close the gripper around the mug  4. Move the mug to target location
    The gripper should first align the gripper just above the mug so that the mug is to the left of the gripper while facing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug and the robot's gripper is aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the robot's gripper is not around the mug, drop the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug
    If the gripper is around the mug, the gripper can close on it and control the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug is below the gripper as seen from above, we have the mug controlled. Now just move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the mug is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
