    Steps: 1. Line up the gripper as viewed from front  2. Push down on the button from the front
    We should line up the robot's gripper from the front to make sure that the button is in its target before we attempt to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button 
    Once the robot's gripper is lined up with the button from the front, we can push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
