    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Push down on the drawer  3. Push back until the drawer is closed
    Before pushing the drawer, we need to line up the robot's gripper from above because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we can push down on the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the drawer handle
    If the gripper is above the drawer handle, push down until the drawer is closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper to the nearest wall or object near the drawer
