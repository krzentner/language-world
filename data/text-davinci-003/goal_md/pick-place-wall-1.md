Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move gripper to right of wall  5. Move robot forward until gripper is left of wall  6. Move gripper to target location with wall between gripper and puck  7. Move gripper with wall between gripper and puck until puck is at goal location
    
We need to adjust our strategy because of the wall. First, we need to move the gripper to the right of the wall to avoid hitting the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not right of wall and the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is right of the wall. 
Once the gripper is right of the wall, we can move the robot forward until the gripper is left of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is right of wall and the robot's gripper is not left of wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is above the puck
Now we are in a position to grab the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed 
Finally, we can move the puck to the target location with the wall between the gripper and the puck. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is near the target location with the wall between the gripper and the puck. Once the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper with the wall between the gripper and the puck until the puck is at the goal location.
