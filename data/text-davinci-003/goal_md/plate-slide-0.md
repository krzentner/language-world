    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate on edge  2. Grasp plate and pinch the plate inside the gripper  3. Slide plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate while holding it at the edge so that we can grasp it and slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is aligned with the plate, we can grab the plate. Donâ€™t close the gripper yet. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the edge of the plate and the robot's gripper is open
    Once the gripper is near the edge of the plate, close the gripper and pinch it against the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the edge of the plate and robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
