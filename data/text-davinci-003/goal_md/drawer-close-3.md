Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the drawer handle  2. Start pushing against the drawer handle to close the drawer  3. Push the drawer closed harder
    If the the drawer handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper to the right of the drawer handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the drawer handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle we can probably slide the drawer closed now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the drawer handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to close the drawer, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the drawer handle
