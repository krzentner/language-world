    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Drop gripper around the dial  3. Turn the dial
    First, put the gripper roughly above the dial. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up above the dial, we can grab it by turning the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    When the robot's gripper is around the dial, then turn the dial with the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial
