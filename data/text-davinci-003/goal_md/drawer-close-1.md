     Steps:  1. Put gripper above the drawer handle  2. Push the texture of the drawer handle  3. Release the drawer gradually
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can push it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to push the drawer handle by moving the gripper down and pushing the texture of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    With the gripper closed, the robot can push the drawer handle gently until it slides into the frame.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper gradually until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle
