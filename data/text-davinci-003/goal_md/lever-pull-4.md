    Steps:  1. Put gripper below lever  2. Close gripper around lever  3. Pull lever up
    We need to put the gripper below the lever before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is open
    Now that the gripper is lined up below the lever, we should be able to grab the lever by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once we have the lever trapped in the gripper, we can just pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
