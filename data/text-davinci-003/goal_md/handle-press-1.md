 
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push handle down
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    If the gripper is around the handle, push down on it to trigger the handle.
    -When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle
