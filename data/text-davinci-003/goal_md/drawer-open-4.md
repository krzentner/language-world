    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Pull the drawer open 
    If the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We want to be careful here to make sure we're trying to pull the handle instead of pushing the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the drawer handle
    If the gripper is almost lined up with the drawer handle, pull the drawer open by moving the gripper to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the drawer handle
