    Steps:  1. Put gripper below plate  2. Push back plate to desired location
    We need to place the gripper underneath the plate, to hold it and provide traction while pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate, move the gripper beneath the plate to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
