    - When the robot's gripper is not slightly below puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is slightly below the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    We can push the puck and slide it to the target location if the gripper is slightly below the puck. 
    - When the robot's gripper is slightly below puck and the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck
    Now that the gripper is behind the puck, push it a bit by moving the gripper upwards.

    If the gripper is slightly below the puck, slide it to the target location.
