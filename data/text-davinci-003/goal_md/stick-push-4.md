    Steps: 1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Grab the stick with gripper  3. Angle the stick towards the thermos  4. Push the thermos with the stick to the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper near the stick so that it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick
    Now that the gripper is near the stick, we can grab the stick by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper has the stick, we need to angle the stick so that it will push the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pointing at the thermos
    Once the stick is angled correctly, pushing the thermos with the stick towards the target should be simple.
    - When the stick is pointing at the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
