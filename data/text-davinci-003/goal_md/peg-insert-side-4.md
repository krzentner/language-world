    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Drop gripper around the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Move peg towards the hole  5. Move peg into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg so that we can grab it without bumping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the peg, we can probably close the gripper and trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the hole
    If the gripper is nearer the hole, slide the peg into it.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg has entered the hole
