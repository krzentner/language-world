    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down the handle
    To press the handle, we need to get the robot's gripper close to the handle so it can push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, the gripper is ready to grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
