    Steps:  1. Move the robot's arm to the target location 
To move the robot's arm to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1.Calculate the position and orientation of the robot wrist for optimal reach  2. Move robot wrist to target orientation  3. Move robot wrist to target position
    First, calculate the position and orientation of the robot wrist for optimal reach. Depending on the exact setup of the robot, the exact position and orientation of the robot's wrist may vary in order to provide the maximum reach.
    - When the robot's wrist is not in the correct orientation, move the robot's wrist until the robot's wrist is at the correct orientation
    Once the robot's wrist is at the correct orientation, we can move the wrist to the target position.
    - When the robot's wrist is at the correct orientation, move the robot's wrist until the robot's wrist is at the target location
