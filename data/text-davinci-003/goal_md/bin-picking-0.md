   Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move cube to target bin  5. Place cube in target bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube, so that we don't mistakenly grab the wrong object.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't near the cube, move the gripper to the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin
    Once the gripper is near the target bin, move the gripper up slightly.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
    Finally, open the gripper to drop the cube in the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
