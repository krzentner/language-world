    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Move block to target location 
    First, put the gripper roughly above block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
