    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the handle from the side  2. Push down on the handle
    We need to line up the robot's gripper with the handle from the side. 
     - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle from the side, we can just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
