    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the faucet handle  2. Start pushing against the faucet handle to close the faucet  3. Push the faucet closed harder
    We should line up the robot's gripper around the faucet handle before pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, we can just push the faucet closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the faucet handle
