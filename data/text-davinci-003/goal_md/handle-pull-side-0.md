     Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle up to the top  3. Move the handle to the left
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle evenly, we should be able to pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is not near top of handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the top of the handle
    Once the handle is near the top, move it to the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is above top of handle and the handle is not horizontally aligned with the left side, move the robot's gripper until the handle is horizontally aligned with the left side
