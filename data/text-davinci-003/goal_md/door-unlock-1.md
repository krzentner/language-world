Steps:  1. Put gripper directly in front of the handle  2. Curl finger around the door handle  3. Turn the door handle counter-clockwise
    We need to start by positioning the gripper directly in front of handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can curl the gripper around it. Make sure to spread it out so that we can adjust the direction easily.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    We just need to move the gripper counter-clockwise around the knob to unlock it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the door handle, move the robot's gripper in a counter-clockwise motion around the door handle
