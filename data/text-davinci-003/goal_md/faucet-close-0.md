    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the side  2. Turn the faucet right
    We need to line the gripper up as viewed from the side, so that the robot can get a good grip on the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the faucet and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just turn the faucet right.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet
