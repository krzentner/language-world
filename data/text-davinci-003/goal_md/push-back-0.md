    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    To slide the puck backwards, we want to trap the puck by pushing down on it from behind. If the puck isn't behind the gripper as seen from the side, move the gripper towards the back of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
