    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top, pushing the wall downwards
    We should line the gripper up from above, just like with the other button press task, and then push down on the button against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, push down on the button while pushing the wall downwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the wall is not downwards, move the robot's gripper until the wall is downwards
