    Steps:  1. Move the gripper above the button  2. Move the gripper around the wall and to the button  3. Push down on the button
    The only difference between this task and the previous is that a wall is in the way, so we need to move the gripper around the wall to get to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, move it around the wall and to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wall and near the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wall and near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
