    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the wrench  2. Pull the wrench off the peg 
    First, put the gripper around the wrench so that the robot can maintain a grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed

    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is upwards aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
