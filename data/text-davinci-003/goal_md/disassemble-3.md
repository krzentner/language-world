Steps:  1. Line up gripper above the wrench  2. Move gripper down to wedge the wrench  3. Pull the wrench up 
    First, line up the gripper as seen from above. This Gripper should be directly over the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench 
    Now that we have the gripper above the wrench, move the gripper down to wedge the wrench and pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench 
    Once the wrench is wedged between the gripper and the peg, pull the wrench up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is some distance away from the peg
