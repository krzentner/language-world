Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move the puck away from the wall  5. Move the puck to the goal

First, put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
Once the gripper is above the puck, move the gripper around the puck to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
Now that the gripper is around the puck, we should move the puck away from the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot is close to the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from the wall
Once the puck is out of the way of the wall, we can move the puck to the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is away from the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
