    Steps:  1. Line the robot's gripper up with the hammer and the nail  2. Bring the hammer down on the nail  3. Strike the nail with the hammer
    First, the robot should line up the gripper with the hammer and the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer
    If the robot's gripper is aligned above the hammer but not near the nail, move the gripper towards the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the nail and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once it is lined up, just move the gripper down so that the hammer moves downwards and strikes the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is near the nail
