    Steps:  1. Position the gripper on the left side of the stick    2. Grab the stick with the gripper   3. Pull the stick towards the thermos until the thermos starts to move   4. Slowly pull the thermos towards the target location
    First, put the gripper on the left side of the stick - this will give us more control when we grab the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the stick
    Once the gripper is left of the stick, just grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the stick, we can pull it towards the thermos until the thermos starts to move.
    - When the thermos is not moving, move the robot's gripper until the thermos starts to move
    Once the thermos is moving, we can slowly pull it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
