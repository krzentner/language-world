    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the side of the plate  2. Slide the plate to goal
    Place the robot's gripper around the side of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the side of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is aligned with the gripper from the side, then we can slide the plate to the target location.
    - When the plate is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the plate is horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper
    If the plate is aligned with the gripper, then we can slide the plate to the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
