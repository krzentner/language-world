    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Move peg toward the hole  4. Move peg into the hole  5. Push peg into the hole
    First, put the gripper roughly above the peg, so that we can grab it without knocking it around like if we tried to grab it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Since the peg itself is thin, we should try to grab the peg sideways so it fits into the hole easier.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the peg and closed, we can move the peg towards the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above hole 
    Once the peg is over the hole, we can move it into the hole, and then push it down into the hole more.
    - When the robot's gripper is above hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below hole and the peg is in the hole
