    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube left or right to target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
    If the cube becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the cube.
    - When the cube is not left of the robot's gripper and the cube is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is tight around the cube, move the cube left or right to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
