    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the door handle  2. Put gripper around the door handle  3. Push the door close harder towards the target location
    First, move the robot's gripper above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we have the gripper above the door handle, let's line it up to the correct side by moving the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, let's push the door closed harder towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
