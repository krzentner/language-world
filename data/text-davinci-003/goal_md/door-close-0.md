Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the door handle  2. Start pushing against the door handle to close the door  3. Push the door closed harder
    If the the door handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the door handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the door handle we can probably slide the door close now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the door handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the door handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is pointing away from the door target location
