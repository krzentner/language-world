    Steps:  1. Put gripper ahead of the plate  2. Push the plate into the target location  3. Push the plate harder until the plate is in target location
    We don't have to line the gripper up with the plate exactly, so just move the gripper forward of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward of the plate
    If the plate isn't in the target location, slide the plate back by pushing it with the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward of the plate and the plate is not in target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
    If the plate has moved at least part of the way back, but hasn't hit the target location, push a little harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location and the plate is not in target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in target location
