    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Push down the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle, from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is lined up with the handle (but not near it), we can just push down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not near handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
