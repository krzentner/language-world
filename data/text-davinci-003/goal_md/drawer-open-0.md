    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Pull the drawer open
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pulling it open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the drawer handle, we can pull the drawer open now.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of drawer handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle
