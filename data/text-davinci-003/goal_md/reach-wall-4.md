    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wall  2. Move gripper around wall  3. Line up with target  4. Reach target
    We need to make sure the gripper is placed above the wall first, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wall
    When the gripper is lined up with the wall, it should be able to move around it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is around the wall
    Finally, line up the gripper with the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is around the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target 
    Now we can reach the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target and the robot's gripper is not above target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target
