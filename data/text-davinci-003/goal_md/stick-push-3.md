    Steps:
    1. Put gripper on the stick  2. Pull stick towards robot  3. Push stick away from robot and towards the target location 
    First we need to put the robot's gripper on the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick
    Once the robot's gripper is near the stick, we can start pulling it towards the robot.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is not on the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the stick
    If the gripper is on the stick, we can start pushing it away from the robot and towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
