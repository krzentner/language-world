    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push plate backwards  3. Slide plate into the goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the plate is more forward, we need to push it backwards.
    - When the plate is not further back than target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate, and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
    As the plate is being pushed back, when the plate is lined up with the target location, we can slide it into the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not at target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
