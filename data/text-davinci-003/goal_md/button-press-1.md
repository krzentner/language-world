    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from front  2. Push down on the button
    We need to line up the gripper from the front before we can push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is lined up with the button, we need to push down to activate it.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
