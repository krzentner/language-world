Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the puck  2. Push gripper into front of puck  3. Slide puck backwards to goal
    We can move the puck backwards by trapping it with the gripper and pushing against the front of the puck. If the puck isn't in front of the gripper as seen from in front, move the gripper in front of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of puck and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper towards the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Push with the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the target location
