    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Pull up on peg with gripper  4. Move peg to target
    We can't just move straight into the hole, so we need to start by lifting the gripper up to the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the peg, pull up on the peg with the gripper to lift it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg but not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Once the peg is above the hole, we can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
