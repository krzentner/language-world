Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck backwards by trapping it by pushing down on it from behind and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't in front of the gripper as seen from behind, move the gripper behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the target location
