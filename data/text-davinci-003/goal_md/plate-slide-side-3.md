    Steps:  1. Put gripper near plate's midpoint  2. Slide gripper sideways until plate is in target location 
    First, put the gripper near the plate's midpoint on the side closest to the target location. This will minimize the error while sliding the plate sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near plate's midpoint, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate's midpoint
    If the gripper is near the plate's midpoint, we can start sliding it into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate's midpoint, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
