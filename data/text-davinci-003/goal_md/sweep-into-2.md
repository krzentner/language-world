    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Sweep the cube to the target location
    We need to put the gripper above the cube before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the robot's gripper is above the cube, the robot should drop it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the gripper is near the cube and closed, sweep the cube to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
