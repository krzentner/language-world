    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move the cube to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
    If the cube is left of the gripper, put the gripper down around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
