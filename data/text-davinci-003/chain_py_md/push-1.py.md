Here's the code that would complete the task:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper behind the puck
    #  2. Push the puck sideways to goal
    # First, put the gripper behind the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper behind the puck")
    # Once the gripper is behind the puck, start pushing the puck away from the
    # gripper to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind the puck"):
        robot.push("the puck sideways to goal")
```
