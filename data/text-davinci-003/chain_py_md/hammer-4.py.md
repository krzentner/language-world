Below is the updated code:

```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the hammer
    #  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper
    #  3. Line the hammer up with the nail
    #  4. Push the hammer down onto the nail
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the hammer, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
        robot.place("gripper above hammer")
    # If the gripper isn't around the hammer, put it around the hammer.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around hammer and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around hammer")
    # If the gripper is near the hammer and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near hammer and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around hammer")
    # We closed the gripper, and the hammer is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to line the hammer up with the nail.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above hammer and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.align("hammer to nail")
        robot.push("down onto nail")
