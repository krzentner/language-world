Here's the code:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Push gripper into the plate
    #  3. Slide the plate to the goal
    # Put the gripper above the plate so that we don't strike the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above plate"):
        robot.place("gripper above plate")
    # If the gripper is not touching the plate, push it into the plate to start sliding
    if check("the robot's gripper is not touching the plate"):
        robot.push("gripper into the plate")
    # If the gripper is touching the plate, slide the plate to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is touching the plate"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
 ```
