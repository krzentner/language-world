The program should be as follows:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the top of the wall
    #  2. Push gripper into the wall
    #  3. Reach around the wall to the target 
    # First, put the gripper above the wall. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the top of the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above the top of the wall")
    # If the gripper isn't near the wall, move it in further to start pushing.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.push("gripper into the wall")
    # When the gripper is near the wall, reach around the wall to the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall"):
        robot.reach("around the wall to the target")
```
