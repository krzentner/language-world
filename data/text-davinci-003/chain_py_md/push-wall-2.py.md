Here's the program:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the puck
    #  2. Push the wall away from the puck
    #  3. Push the puck to the goal
    # First, put the gripper above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    # For the best control, we need to keep the wall between the gripper and
    # the puck.
    # To do that, we need to push away from the wall to the side the puck is on.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the puck is not between the gripper and the wall"):
        robot.push("wall away from puck")
    # once we have the wall away from the puck, push the puck to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the puck is between the gripper and the wall"):
        robot.push("puck towards goal")
