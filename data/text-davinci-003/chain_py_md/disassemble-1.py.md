```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wrench 
    #  2. Line up the gripper from behind the wrench
    #  3. Pull up on the wrench
    # First, put the gripper roughly above wrench, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.place("gripper above wrench")
    # If the gripper isn't behind the wrench, line it up from behind the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.align("gripper behind wrench")
    # If the gripper is behind the wrench and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind the wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around wrench")
    # We closed the gripper, and the wrench is still near the gripper, so maybe
    # we grabbed it.
    # Try to pull the wrench off the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind wrench and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("up on wrench")
