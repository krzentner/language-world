The code should be:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench
    #  2. Drop gripper around wrench
    #  3. Pull wrench off the peg
    # We need to lift the wrench off the peg before trying to pull it off.
    # To do that, put the gripper above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the wrench, we should be able to grab
    # the wrench by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench")
    # Once the gripper is around the wrench, we can just pull the wrench off
    # the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around wrench and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("wrench from peg")
```
