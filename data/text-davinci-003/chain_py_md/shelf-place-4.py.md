The steps for shelf-place are: 
1. Put gripper above block
2. Drop gripper around block
3. Grab block with gripper
4. Move block to target location

Here's the code to do it:

```
# shelf-place: pick up the block and place it at the target location
def shelf_place(robot): 
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above block
    #  2. Drop gripper around block
    #  3. Grab block with gripper
    #  4. Move block to target location
    # First, put the gripper above the block.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.put("gripper above block")
    # If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around block")
    # If the gripper is near enough to the block and it's open, 
    # grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("block with gripper")
    # Once the gripper is around the block, try to move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the block"):
        robot.place("block at target location")
```
