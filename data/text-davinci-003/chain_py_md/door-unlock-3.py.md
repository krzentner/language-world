Here's the code:
```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Move the gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial clockwise
    #  4. Move the dial counter-clockwise to the desired number
    # First, put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.place("gripper above dial")
    # If the gripper is above the dial, move it around the dial to align it.
    # We don't need to be exact here, as long as the gripper won't bump the
    # dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost above the dial"):
        robot.move("gripper around dial")
    # If the gripper is above the dial, we can start turning it. Start by 
    # turning it counter-clockwise, since most door locks go this way.
    # We don't need to turn it very far, just don't go the wrong way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the dial"):
        robot.turn("dial counter-clockwise")
    # As long as the dial is turning and the robot's gripper is still above 
    # the dial, continue turning it until the desired number is reached.
    if check("the dial is turning and the robot's gripper is above the dial"):
        robot.turn("dial to desired number")
