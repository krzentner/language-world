# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper above target location
    #  2. Put gripper around target location avoiding obstacles
    #  3. Move gripper to target location
    # First, move the gripper above the target location to plan an appropriate path.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move("gripper above target location")
    # If the gripper is more or less above the target location, move it to the 
    # target location, trying to avoid any obstacles in the way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.put("gripper around target location, avoiding obstacles")
    # If the gripper is around the target location, move the gripper to it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move("gripper to target location")
