# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the plate
    #  2. Slide the plate back with the gripper
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the plate is still left of the gripper, now we can slide it back to the
    # target location.
    if check("the plate is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("plate to the right")
    # If the plate is almost lined up with the target location, push it in the
    # rest of the way.
    if check("the plate is right of the target location and is almost lined up with the target location"):
        robot.push("plate into target location")
