Then, we need to define the steps that the robot should take to slide the plate back sideways. The steps should be:

1. Put gripper above plate
2. Push the plate back at an angle
3. Slide plate sideways into the target location

We can then define each step with code:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push the plate back at an angle
    #  3. Slide plate sideways into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # Then, push the plate back at an angle
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.push("plate back at angle")
    # Finally, slide the plate sideways into the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.slide("plate sideways")
```
