Next, the steps: 

1. Put the gripper above the dial
2. Drop the gripper around the dial
3. Turn the dial clockwise to lock the door

Assuming the correct code is written for the `check()` function: 

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial clockwise to lock the door
    # Put the gripper near the dial 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above the dial")
    # If the gripper is lined up above the dial, we can grab the dial by moving
    # the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the dial")
    # Once the gripper is around the dial, turn it clockwise to lock the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
        robot.turn("clockwise")
```
