From here, the code would look like this:

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door handle
    #  2. Put gripper around door handle
    #  3. Twist the dial
    # First, put the gripper around the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    # If the gripper isn't around the door handle after it moves above the door
    # handle, then move the gripper around the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the door handle, twist the dial to lock the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door handle"):
        robot.twist("the dial clockwise")
    
```
