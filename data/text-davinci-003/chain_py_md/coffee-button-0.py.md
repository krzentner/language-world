The code to push the button on the coffee machine would look something like this:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Drop gripper around the button
    #  3. Push the button down
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the button, so that we don't bump it 
    # while trying to push it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # If the gripper isn't around the button, put it around the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around button and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around button")
    # If the gripper is near the button and open, grab it by pushing down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
