Now, we need to pick up the puck, but there is a short wall in the way. Weâ€™ll need to use the same steps we would to pick up the puck without a wall. The steps are:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move puck to goal

However, to do so, we must first align the gripper correctly with the puck, making sure it is high enough to not hit the wall in the way.

1. Put gripper above wall
2. Drop gripper to the side of the wall
3. Move gripper above puck, ensuring it is high enough to not hit the wall
4. Drop gripper around puck
5. Close gripper around puck
6. Move puck to goal
