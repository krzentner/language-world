Then, the Solution:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lever
    #  2. Drop gripper around lever
    #  3. Start pushing the lever up
    #  4. Push harder
    # We need to put the gripper above the lever before we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the lever, we should be able to grab 
    # the lever by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is not around lever"):
        robot.drop("gripper around lever")
    # Once the gripper is around the lever, we can start pushing the lever up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around lever and the lever is not in the up position"):
        robot.push("lever up")
    # If the lever is not fully rotated up, keep pushing.
    if check("the lever is not fully rotated up"):
        robot.push("lever up harder")
