Solution:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move robot's gripper to the left of the wall
    #  2. Reach the target
    # To reach the target with a wall in the way, we will need to move the
    # robot's gripper to the left of the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of wall")
    # Once the gripper is to the left of the wall, we can reach the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the wall"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
