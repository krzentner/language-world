The program would look like this:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach near wall in line with the target
    #  2. Move arm up so the gripper is above the wall
    #  3. Reach towards the target
    # Move the gripper near the wall, in line with the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall in line with the target"):
        robot.reach("near wall in line with the target")
    # Move the arm up so the gripper is above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move("arm up above the wall")
    # Finally, reach to the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```
