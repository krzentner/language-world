Then add the following code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the door dial
    #  2. Grab the dial with the gripper
    #  3. Turn the dial clockwise
    #  4. Pull open the door
    # First, put the gripper near the door dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door dial"):
        robot.put("gripper near door dial")
    # If the gripper is not around the dial yet, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the door dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around door dial")
    # Once the gripper is around the dial, turn it clockwise until it clicks.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door dial"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise")
    # Once it clicks, we should be able to pull the door open.
    if check("the dial is unlocked"):
        robot.pull("door open")
```
