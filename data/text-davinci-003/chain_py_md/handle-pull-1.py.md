Here's the code:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Line the gripper up with handle
    #  3. Close gripper around handle
    #  4. Pull up on the handle
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above handle"):
        robot.place("gripper above handle")
    # We also need to make sure that the gripper is lined up with the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle"):
        robot.align("gripper to handle")
    # Once the robot's gripper is lined up, close the gripper around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle")
    # If the gripper is closed around the handle, we can start to pull up on the
    # handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
