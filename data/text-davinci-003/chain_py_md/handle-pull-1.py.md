The code that follows should read as such:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle 
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Pull the handle up
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Next, put the gripper around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, pull the handle up.
    if check("robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```
