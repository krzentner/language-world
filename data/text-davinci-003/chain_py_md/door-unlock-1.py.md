The code for the program should be:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper near the dial
    #  2. Orient the gripper so that it is aligned with the dial
    #  3. Rotate the gripper to turn the dial to the correct position
    # First, put the gripper near the door dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the dial"):
        robot.move("gripper to near dial")
    # Once the gripper is near the dial, line it up with the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial"):
        robot.align("gripper to dial")
    # If the gripper is lined up with the dial, we can rotate the gripper to turn
    # the dial to the correct position.
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the dial"):
        robot.rotate("gripper to unlock door")
```
