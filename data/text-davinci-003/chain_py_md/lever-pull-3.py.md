# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the lever
    #  2. Grab the lever with the gripper
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # Put the gripper above the lever, so that the gripper doesn't accidentally
    # hit the lever while grabbing it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    # Once the gripper is above the lever, grasp the lever with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("lever")
    # If the gripper is around the lever and the lever is not pointing up,
    # rotate it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the lever is not pointing up"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
