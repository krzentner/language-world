    if check("the robot's gripper is not at the top of the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper at the top of the stick")

    if check("the stick is not near the thermos"):
        robot.move("stick to the thermos")

    if check("the stick is near the thermos"):
        robot.push("stick against the thermos")

     if check("thermos is not near target"):
        robot.slide("thermos to the target location")
