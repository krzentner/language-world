def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Grab stick with gripper
    #  3. Move gripper and stick to target location, pushing thermos as you go
    #  4. Release stick
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    # If the stick is left of the gripper's line of sight, grab the stick.
    if check("stick is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the stick") :
        robot.grab("stick")
    # As long as the gripper is still mostly around the stick and the stick isn't near the goal, move the stick towards the goal pushing the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not near the goal"):
        robot.push("stick towards goal pushing thermos")
    # If the stick is near the goal, release the stick.
    if check("the stick is near the goal"):
        robot.release("stick")
```
