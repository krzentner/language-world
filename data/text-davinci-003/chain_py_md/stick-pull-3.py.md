The program should be written as follows:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the stick
    #  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    #  3. Put the stick under the thermos
    #  4. Pull thermos towards the target
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the stick so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    # If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    # If the gripper is around the stick and the thermos isn't above it, put the
    # stick under the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around stick and the thermos is not above stick"):
        robot.place("stick under thermos")
    # Now that the thermos is above the stick, just pull the thermos towards the target.
    if check("the thermos is above the stick"):
        robot.pull("thermos toward target")
