Here is your solution:

```
# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
def hand_insert(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper above puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    # Once the gripper is above the puck, drop it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # If we caught the puck, move the puck to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the puck"):
        robot.move("puck to goal")
