Here's the solution:

```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Drop gripper around stick
    #  3. Close gripper around stick
    #  4. Move stick to top of thermos
    #  5. Push thermos to target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above stick, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.place("gripper above stick")
    # If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around stick")
    # If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around stick")
    # We closed the gripper, and the stick is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the stick to the top of the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("stick to top of thermos")
    # If the stick is aligned with the top of the thermos, push the thermos to
    # the target location.
    if check("the stick is aligned with the top of the thermos"):
        robot.push("thermos to target location")
