The program should be as follows:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    #  3. Line the stick up with the handle of the thermos
    #  4. Pull the thermos with the stick
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    # If the stick becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the stick.
    # Because the stick is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with
    # it from the front instead of around it.
    if check("stick is not left of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    # As long as the gripper is still mostly around the stick and the stick isn't
    # lined up with the thermos handle, line up the stick with the handle of the
    # thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not aligned with the handle of the thermos"):
        robot.align("stick to the handle of the thermos")
    # If the stick is lined up with the handle of the thermos, pull the thermos
    # with the stick.
    if check("stick is aligned with the handle of the thermos"):
        robot.pull("thermos with stick")
