The steps would be:
1. Put the gripper above the stick
2. Grab the stick with the gripper
3. Line the stick up with the thermos
4. Push the thermos toward the target location using the stick

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, we should move the gripper near the stick to start grabbing it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.move("gripper to above the stick")
```

Once the robot's gripper is above the stick, we can grab it by closing the gripper around it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("stick")
```

Once the robot's gripper has a hold on the stick, we can try to line up the stick with the thermos using the gripper. 

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not horizontally aligned with thermos"):
        robot.align("stick to thermos")
```

Once the stick is lined up with the thermos, we can push the thermos with the stick toward the target location.

```
    if check("the stick is horizontally aligned with thermos"):
        robot.push("thermos toward goal")
```
