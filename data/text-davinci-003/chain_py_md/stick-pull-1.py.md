Here's the program:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Drop gripper around stick
    #  3. Close gripper around stick
    #  4. Put the top of stick under the bottom of the thermos 
    #  5. Pull the stick back to move the thermos

    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    # If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the stick")
    # If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around stick")
    # We closed the gripper, and the stick is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to put the top of the stick under the bottom of the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.put("the top of the stick under the bottom of the thermos")
    # If the top of the stick is now under the bottom of the thermos, try to move
    # the thermos to its target for next step. 
    if check("the top of the stick is under the bottom of the thermos"):
