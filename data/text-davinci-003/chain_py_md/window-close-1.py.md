Then complete the code with the following steps:

1. Put gripper left of the window handle 
2. start pushing against the window handle to close the window 
3. Push the window closed harder

```
# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle,
    # we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is to the left of the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window closed now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
