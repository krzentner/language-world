```
# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
def hand_insert(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # We need to put the gripper above the puck before we can grab it,
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the puck, we should be able to
    # grab the puck by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # Once the gripper is around the puck, we can just close the gripper
    # to pick it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # Once the gripper is closed around the puck, we can move it to
    # the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("puck to goal")
