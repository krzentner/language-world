Here's the code you can use:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push gripper into top of plate
    #  3. Slide plate back to goal
    # To move the plate back, we can trap it and slide it by pushing down from
    # above with the gripper.
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the gripper is align with the plate but not near it, move the gripper
    # down to the plate to trap it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate"):
        robot.push("gripper into top of plate")
    # If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
        robot.slide("plate back to goal")
```
