  

First, the gripper must be positioned above the lever.

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lever
    # Put the gripper above the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
```

Next, the gripper must be positioned around the lever, allowing for easy rotation.

```
    #  2. Drop gripper around lever
    # Drop the gripper around the lever, allowing for a good grip.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around lever")
```

Finally, the lever must be rotated up.

```
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # Rotate the lever up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around lever"):
        robot.pull("lever up")
```
