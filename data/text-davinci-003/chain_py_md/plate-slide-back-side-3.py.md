    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Put gripper to the side of the plate
    #  3. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the gripper isn't lined up with the plate to the side, move it to the
    # side of the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move("gripper to side of plate")
    # As long as the gripper is lined up and the plate is below it, slide the
    # plate back sideways into the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("plate back")
