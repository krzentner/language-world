def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the faucet's handle
    #  2. Turn the faucet handle left
    # First, position the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above the faucet handle")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, rotate the faucet handle left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet handle left")
```
