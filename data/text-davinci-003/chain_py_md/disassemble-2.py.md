The code to perform the disassemble task should be as follows:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Put the gripper below the wrench
    #  4. Move the wrench off the peg
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # If the gripper is front aligned with the peg, put the gripper below the
    # wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with peg"):
        robot.put("gripper below wrench")
    # If the robot's gripper is below the wrench, try to move the wrench off the
    # peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is below the wrench"):
        robot.move("wrench off peg")
