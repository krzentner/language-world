```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push plate into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to push it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # Once the gripper is above the plate, just push the plate into the target 
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.push("plate into the target location")
