The steps are as follows: 

1. Put gripper above the peg 
2. Drop gripper in the hole 
3. Grab the peg with the gripper 
4. Lift the peg up and out of the hole 
5. Close the gripper around the peg 
6. Move the peg to the target location 

The code would look like this:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Drop gripper in the hole
    #  3. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  4. Lift the peg up and out of the hole
    #  5. Close the gripper around the peg
    #  6. Move the peg to the target location
    # Put the gripper above the peg and the hole
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.place("gripper above peg and hole")
    # If the robot's gripper is above the hole, drop it down in the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hole"):
        robot.drop("gripper in the hole")
    # If the robot's gripper is in the hole, grab the peg with the robot's
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in the hole"):
        robot.grab("peg with gripper")
    # If the robot's gripper is around the peg, lift it out of the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.lift("peg from hole")
    # If the peg is out of the hole, close the gripper around it.
    if check("the peg is out of the hole"):
        robot.close("gripper around the peg")
    # Finally, move the peg to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.place("peg at target location")
