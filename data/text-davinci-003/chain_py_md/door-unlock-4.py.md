    if check("the robot's gripper is not above and slightly to the right of the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above and to the right of dial")
    # If the dial is left of the gripper, grab it with the gripper.
    if check("the dial is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("dial")
    # Now that the dial is in the robot's left hand, rotate it clockwise until
    # it clicks into place.
    if check("the dial is in the robot's left hand and the dial is not rotated clockwise"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise until it clicks")
    # Finally, if it is clicked into place, pull the door open.
    if check("the dial is clicked into place"):
        robot.pull("door open")
