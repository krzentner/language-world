The program would look something like this:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the wall
    #  2. Reach up
    #  3. Reach over the wall
    #  4. Reach to the target
    # To begin, reach towards the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.reach("towards the wall")
    # Once the gripper is near the wall, move up until it's just above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.reach("up to above the wall")
    # Once the gripper is above the wall, reach to the side to get past the wall.
    if check("the robot is gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not past the wall"):
        robot.reach("over the wall")
    # Once the gripper is past the wall, reach to the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is past the wall"):
        robot.reach("to the target")
