```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper to the right of the button
    #  2. Put the gripper snuggly against the wall
    #  3. Push the button down
    # Move the gripper to the right of the button, so that the wall will be
    # between the gripper and the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the button"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of button")
    # Now put the gripper against the wall, so that the gripper won't slip while
    # pushing the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not against wall"):
        robot.put("gripper against wall")
    # Now that the gripper is against the wall, push the button down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is against wall"):
        robot.push("down on button")
