Then add the following code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the wrench up with the peg
    #  4. Close the gripper around the wrench
    #  5. Wrap the wrench around the peg
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the wrench isn't lined
    # up with the peg line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with peg"):
        robot.align("wrench to peg")
    # If the wrench is lined up with the peg, close the gripper around the wrench
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the wrench is horizontally aligned with peg"):
        robot.close("gripper around wrench")
    # If the gripper is closed around the wrench, we can wrap the wrench around
    # the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench"):
        robot.wrap("wrench around peg")
