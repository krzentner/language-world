Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle

The task `push` requires the robot to slide the puck to the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to insert the peg into the hole from the side.
To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle

The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
