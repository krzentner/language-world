Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `drawer-open` requires the robot to pull the drawer open.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Pull open the drawer
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle

The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle

The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

The task `drawer-close` requires the robot to push the drawer close.
To push the drawer close reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
