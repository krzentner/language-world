Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle

The task `drawer-open` requires the robot to pull the drawer open.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Pull open the drawer
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole

The task `push` requires the robot to slide the puck to the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle

The task `pick-place` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle

The task `drawer-close` requires the robot to push the drawer close.
To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Push the drawer closed
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
    If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

The task `coffee-button` requires the robot to push the button on the coffee machine.
To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, what steps the robot should perform? The robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Find button  2. Put gripper above button  3. Push the button
    First, find the button
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the coffee machine, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the coffee machine
    Once the gripper is near the coffee machine, start aligning the gripper with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
