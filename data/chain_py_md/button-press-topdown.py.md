Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above drawer handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
    #  3. Pull open the drawer
    # We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it,
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to
    # grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer
    # open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")

# window-open: slide the window open to the left
def window_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper right of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window
    #  3. Push the window open harder
    # If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle,
    # we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window open now by moving the gripper left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")

# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
def pick_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")

# drawer-close: push the drawer close
def drawer_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle
    #  2. Push the drawer closed
    # If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer
    # handle.
    # We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large
    # and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    # If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can
    # push the drawer closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")

# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around door handle
    #  3. Pull open the door
    # First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    # As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up
    # all the way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    # As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the door handle,
    # it's being opened, so keep pulling.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.pull("door open")
```

Please write a program to perform the last task, `button-press-topdown`.
Begin with the text:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
```
