Here's the completed code for the `pick-place-wall` function:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        # raise the gripper over the wall
        robot.move("gripper up")
        robot.move("gripper right")
        robot.move("gripper right")
        robot.move("gripper down")
        robot.move("gripper down")
        # move the gripper to the goal location
        robot.move("gripper right")
        robot.move("gripper up")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
```

In this function, we first perform the same checks as in the `pick-place` function. Then, we add some additional steps to raise the gripper over the wall and move it to the goal location. We do this by calling the `move` method on the robot object with the appropriate arguments to move the gripper up, right, left, and down. Finally, we call the `place` method to place the puck at the goal location.
Sure, here's the completed code for the `pick-place-wall` task:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open and there is a short wall in the way"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of the wall")
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open and there is no wall in the way"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")
```

This code first checks if the gripper is already above the puck. If not, the robot moves the gripper to be above the puck. Then, it checks if there is a wall in the gripper's way. If there is, the robot moves the gripper to the side of the wall before dropping it around the puck. If there is no wall in the way, the robot can immediately drop the gripper around the puck. Finally, the robot closes the gripper, moves it to the target location, and opens it again to place the puck at the goal.
```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        if check("the path to the target location is blocked by the wall"):
            robot.move("to the side of the wall")
            robot.move("towards the target location")
            robot.move("back to center")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
``` 

This code first checks if the gripper is above the puck, and proceeds to drop the gripper around it if it is not already around it and the gripper is open. The gripper is then closed, and if the gripper is above the puck and closed, the robot checks if the path to the target location is blocked by the wall. If it is, the robot moves to the side of the wall, moves towards the target location, and then moves back to the center. Finally, the robot places the puck at the goal location.
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the puck is behind the wall and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is next to the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")
Here's a program to perform the `pick-place-wall` task:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck over wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above goal"):
        robot.move("gripper over goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above goal and the robot's gripper is not near goal"):
        robot.move("gripper to goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near goal and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.drop("gripper at goal")
```

This program assumes that there is a short wall between the puck and the goal, and that the robot can pick up the puck, lift it over the wall, carry it to the goal, and place it there. The program checks whether the gripper is in the right position to perform each step of the task, and calls the appropriate methods to move the gripper as needed.
