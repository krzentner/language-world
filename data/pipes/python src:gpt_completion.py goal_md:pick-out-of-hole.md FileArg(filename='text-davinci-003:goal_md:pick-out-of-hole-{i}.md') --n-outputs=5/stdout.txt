 Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Drop gripper into the hole  3. Lift peg out of the hole  4. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg isn't below the gripper, move the gripper down into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in the hole and the peg is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is inside the hole, lift the peg up and out.
    - When the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg 
    If the peg is above the gripper, move the gripper above the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the peg  2. Line up the gripper with the sides of the peg  3. Move upwards, gripping the peg  4. Move the peg to the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper below the peg so that the peg is supported by the gripper when the robot is lifting it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the peg
    Then, line up the robot's gripper with the sides of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once we have a good grip on the peg, move upwards and away from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put closed gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper from the side  3. Pull out the peg  4. Move peg to the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper above the peg. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is above the peg, we can grab the peg with the gripper from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper cannot grab the peg, the robot needs to try to pull it out.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is ahead of the peg
    Once the peg is pulled out, it can be moved to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is ahead of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper into the hole  3. Line gripper up with peg  4. Close gripper around the peg 5. Lift peg out the hole 6. Move peg to target location
    First, move the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
    If the hole is lined up with the gripper seen from above, we can drop the gripper into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is not in the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the hole
    If the gripper is in the hole, check if the gripper is lined up with the peg as seen from below.
    - When the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the peg is aligned with the gripper, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper loosely around peg  2. Pull up the peg  3. Move the peg to target Location 
    To pick up the peg, we first need to put the gripper loosely around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open
    Now that the gripper is nearby, the robot needs to lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    The peg should now be held in the gripper, so let's move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
