Steps:
1. Put gripper above the wrench
2. Drop gripper around the wrench
3. Pull wrench off the peg

First, we need to put the gripper roughly above the wrench, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the wrench")
```

If the gripper isn't around the wrench, put it around the wrench.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the wrench", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is around the wrench, we can just pull the wrench off the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around wrench"):
    robot.move_gripper("away from the peg")
```
