To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
2. When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
3. When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
4. When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the arm to the target location.
5. When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the gripper to the target location while holding the puck and then release the puck.

To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the puck, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the puck by opening the gripper.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the gripper is not above the puck
2. If the gripper is not above the puck, move the gripper above the puck
3. Check if the gripper is not around the puck and is open
4. If the gripper is not around the puck and is open, drop the gripper around the puck
5. Check if the gripper is near the puck and is open
6. If the gripper is near the puck and is open, close the gripper around the puck
7. Check if the gripper is above the puck and is closed
8. If the gripper is above the puck and is closed, move the gripper to the target location and release the puck.
