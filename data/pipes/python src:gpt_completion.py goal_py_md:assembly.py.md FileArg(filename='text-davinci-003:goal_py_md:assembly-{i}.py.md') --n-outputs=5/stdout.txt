Using model: text-davinci-003


The robot can assemble objects by simply grasping one with the gripper and then rotating it around the other. The code would look like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach for the wrench
    #  2. Move the wrench above the peg
    #  3. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    #  4. Rotate the wrench around the peg
    # First, reach for the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wrench")
    # Once the gripper is near the wrench, move it above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # If the gripper isn't close to the wrench, use the gripper to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is close to the wrench and the gripper is closed, we can
    # rotate the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")


Then your code:
```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper 
    #  3. Rotate the tool so the wrench faces the right way 
    #  4. Place the wrench around the peg
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and it is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined
    # up with the wrench, rotate the tool so the wrench faces the right way.
    if check("the peg is right of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not aligned with the peg"):
        robot.rotate_tool("aligned with the peg")
    # After putting the wrench around the peg, let go of the peg.
    if check("the wrench is aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg", close_gripper=False)
```


Then add the following lines to complete the script:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper just above the wrench
    #  2. Put gripper below the peg
    #  3. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  4. Put the wrench around the peg
    # Put the gripper just above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wrench")
    # Put the gripper below the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is not below the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the peg")
    # Grab the peg with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is below the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # Put the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
```


# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper wrench above the peg
    #  2. Drop gripper around the wrench
    #  3. Close gripper around the wrench
    #  4. Move wrench around the peg

    # First, put the gripper above the wrench so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wrench")
    # If the gripper isn't around the wrench, put it around the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the wrench and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # Once the wrench is grabbed, rotate it to place it around the peg.
    if check(robot's gripper is around the wrench):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg", rotate_gripper=True)


Steps:
1. Put the gripper in front of the peg
2. Rotate the gripper to the left to grab the handle of the wrench from the left side
3. Pull the wrench up
4. Put the wrench around the peg carefully
5. Push the end of the wrench back to the peg to ensure it is locked

```
