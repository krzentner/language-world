    - When the robot's gripper is not above plate and the robot's gripper is not vertical aligned with plate, the robot should put the gripper above plate. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, the robot should push the gripper into plate. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.
