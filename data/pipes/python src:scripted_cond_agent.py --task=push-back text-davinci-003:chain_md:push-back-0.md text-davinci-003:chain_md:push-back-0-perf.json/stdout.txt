    Steps:  1. Place gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper behind the puck, so that we don't push it away from us when trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should place gripper behind puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper behind puck.
    Once the gripper is behind the puck, we can just push back to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck and the robot's gripper is open the robot should push back on puck.
