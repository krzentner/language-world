To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above the plate.
- When the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should push the plate towards the target location while keeping it aligned and parallel to the surface it is on.
- When the plate reaches the target location, the robot should release its grip on the plate.
