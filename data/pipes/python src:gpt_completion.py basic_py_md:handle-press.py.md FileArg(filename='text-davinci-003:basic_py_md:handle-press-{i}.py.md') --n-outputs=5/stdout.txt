The code for handle press would then look like this:

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.grab("gripper around handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


Next we will check if the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle: 
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
```
Then, we will check if the gripper is vertically aligned with the handle:
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```
Finally, we will end the block of code:
```
    return
```


The program should be:
```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


Solution:

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on the handle")
```


The code should be:

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")

    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
``
