To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the button  2. Move the robot's gripper forward until it touches the wall  3. Slide the gripper downwards until it is below the wall  4. Move the robot's gripper forward again until it touches the button  5. Push down on the button from the front
Since there is a short wall in the way, the robot needs to approach the button from above. Once it is above the button:
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper forward until it touches the wall
    We need to slide the gripper downwards until it is below the wall to avoid hitting it as we move the gripper forward again:
    - When the robot's gripper touches the wall, move the robot's gripper downwards until it is below the wall
    Now we can move the gripper forward again until it touches the button:
    - When the robot's gripper is below the wall, move the robot's gripper forward again until it touches the button
Finally, we can push down on the button from the front to activate it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
