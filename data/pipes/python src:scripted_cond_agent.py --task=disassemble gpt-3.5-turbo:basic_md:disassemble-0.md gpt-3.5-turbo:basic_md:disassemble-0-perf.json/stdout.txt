To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should place the gripper above the wrench.
- When the gripper is over the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench securely with the gripper.
- When the wrench is in the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper away from the peg.
- When the wrench is no longer attached to the peg, the robot should release the wrench from the gripper.
