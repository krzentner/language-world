    Steps:  1. Reach towards side of wall but short of target  2. Move around wall  3. Reach to target
    Because of the wall, we can't reach to the target straight away.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near side of wall but short of target, the robot should reach to side of wall but short of target.
    Once the robot's gripper is near the side of the wall, move to the target side of the wall, but short of the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is near side of wall but short of target, the robot should move around wall.
    Once the robot's gripper is on the target side of the wall, just reach to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is at target side of wall, the robot should reach to target.
