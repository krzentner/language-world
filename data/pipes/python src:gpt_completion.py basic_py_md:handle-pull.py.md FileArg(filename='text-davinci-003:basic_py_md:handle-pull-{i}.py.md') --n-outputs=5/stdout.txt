Here is the program to perform the task `handle-pull`:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.pull("up on handle")
```


Code:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.place("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper vertically aligned with handle") 
    if check("the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")


The rest of the code is:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


Your code should look like this:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


Answer:
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.place("gripper around handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
