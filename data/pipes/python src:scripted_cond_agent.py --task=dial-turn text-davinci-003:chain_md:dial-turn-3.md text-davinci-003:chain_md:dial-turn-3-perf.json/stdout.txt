    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Line up the gripper with the dial  3. Start turning the dial to the desired position  4. Check to make sure dial is moving
    To turn the dial, we need to first put the gripper near the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should put gripper near dial.
    Then, we need to align the gripper with the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with dial, the robot should align gripper with dial.
    Now, start turning the dial to the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with dial, the robot should start turning dial.
    Keep turning it and checking to make sure it is still turning.
    - When the robot's gripper is still horizontally aligned with dial, the robot should check to make sure dial is still moving.
