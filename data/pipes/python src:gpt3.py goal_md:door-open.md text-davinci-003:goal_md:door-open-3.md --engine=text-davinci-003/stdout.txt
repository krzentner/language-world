    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle
