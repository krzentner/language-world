    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the lock

    #  2. Move hand above door lock
    #  3. Turn dial counterclockwise

    # the dial, so we start by moving the gripper to the side of the door lock.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Line up the gripper with the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial
    # First, the robot should align the gripper with the dial.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door lock
    #  2. Move gripper to lock wheel
    #  3. Turn wheel until the door is locked
