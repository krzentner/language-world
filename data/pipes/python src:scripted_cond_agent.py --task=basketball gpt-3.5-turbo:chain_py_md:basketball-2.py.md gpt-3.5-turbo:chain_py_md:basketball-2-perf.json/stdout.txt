# basketball: put the ball into the hoop

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above ball
    #  2. Drop gripper around ball
    #  3. Close gripper around ball
    #  4. Move gripper to above the hoop
    #  5. Drop ball into the hoop

    # If the gripper is near the ball and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around ball")
    # We closed the gripper and the ball is still near the gripper, so we must have grabbed it.
    # Now move the gripper above the hoop.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above ball and the robot's gripper is closed and the hoop is not in sight"):
        robot.move("gripper to above the hoop")
    # Once the gripper is above the hoop, drop the ball into the hoop.

        robot.drop("ball into the hoop")
