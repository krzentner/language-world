The robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    - When the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target, the robot should align plate to target.
    - When plate is horizontally aligned with target, the robot should move plate to target.
