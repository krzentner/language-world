    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the faucet handle  2. Put gripper under the faucet handle  3. Push the faucet handle left until fully open
    We need to move the gripper near the faucet handle and then put the gripper under it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper near faucet handle.
    Now that the gripper is near the faucet handle, we need to put the gripper under the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not under faucet handle, the robot should put gripper under faucet handle.
    Now that the gripper is under the handle, we can push the handle left to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is under faucet handle, the robot should push faucet handle left until fully open.
