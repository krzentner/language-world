Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the stick
2. Drop the gripper around the stick
3. Close the gripper around the stick
4. Push the stick against the thermos
5. Move the thermos to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move it to the stick. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the stick")
```

If the gripper is above the stick but not around it, move it around the stick.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the stick", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is around the stick, push the stick against the thermos.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the stick"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the thermos")
```

Once the stick is pushing against the thermos, move the thermos to the target location.

```
if check("the thermos is in contact with the stick"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
