    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the button
    #  2. Push down on the button

    # way to line up the robot's gripper with the button.

    # Once the gripper is roughly aligned above the button, try pushing down on
    # it.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the front
    #  2. Push the button
    # To press the button, we can just line up the gripper as seen from the
    # front.

    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Press down on the button
    # First, put the gripper above the button.

    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Put gripper around the button
    #  3. Push the button
    # We should put the gripper above the button to make sure we don't bump it
    # while trying to press it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the button
    #  2. Push down on the button
    # First, put the gripper right next to the button.
