Here's the code for the door-close task:

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around door handle
    #  3. Push the door closed
    # Put the gripper roughly above the door handle before we can grab it, 
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the door handle, we should be able to 
    # grab the door handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the door handle, we just need to push the door
    # closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around door handle"):
        robot.push("door closed")
```
