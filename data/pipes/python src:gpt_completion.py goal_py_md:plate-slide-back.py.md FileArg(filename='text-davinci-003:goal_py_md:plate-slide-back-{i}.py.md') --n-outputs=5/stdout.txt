Steps:
1. Put the gripper in front of plate
2. Push plate back into the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("in front of plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is in front of plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper around plate 
  2. Slide plate to the target location 

First, we need to put the gripper around the plate.
If the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move it to the plate. 
We don't have to be line the gripper up with the plate carefully, since we're sliding the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the plate")
```

Once the gripper is near the plate, close the gripper to grab the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
```

To slide the plate back to the target location, we need to line up the gripper with the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
```

Now the plate should be aligned with the goal and we can slide it back. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
```


Then, add the following code:
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper on the side of the plate
    #  2. Slide the plate back
    # First, put the gripper to the side of the plate, so that it can grip the
    # plate as it slides it back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not next to the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("next to the plate")
    # Once the gripper is next to the plate, the robot can slide it back by 
    # pushing the plate with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is next to the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("behind the plate")


Steps: 
1. Put the robot's gripper on the right side of the plate
2. Securely grip the plate to ensure it slides back properly
3. Move the plate to the target location

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps: 
    #  1. Put the robot's gripper on the right side of the plate
    #  2. Securely grip the plate to ensure it slides back properly
    #  3. Move the plate to the target location
    # Put the gripper on the right of the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the right of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the plate")
    # Secure the plate with the gripper by closing it slightly.
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the right of the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # Slide the plate to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")
```


The goal of this task is to slide a plate back into a target location.

Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the plate
  2. Slide the plate to the left

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move it so that it is.

```    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
```

Once the gripper is above the plate, move it slightly to the left, which should slide the plate back into the target location.

```    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("slightly to the left")
```
