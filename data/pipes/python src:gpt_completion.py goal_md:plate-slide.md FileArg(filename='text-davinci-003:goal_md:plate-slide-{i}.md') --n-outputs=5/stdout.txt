    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Close gripper around plate  4. Slide plate to target
    First, put the robot's gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, move it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, grab the plate tightly.
    - When the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near target location

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper at the top of the plate  2. Push the plate until it's at the target location
    First, get the gripper at the top of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the gripper is near the top of the plate, the robot can start pushing it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location


Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Pull the plate towards the target location  3. Push the plate into the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate
- When the robot's gripper is left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Drop the gripper around plate  3. Close the gripper around plate  4. Slide the plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near top of the plate  2. Grip the plate  3. Push the plate toward the target location
    To slide the plate, first the robot should position the gripper near the top of the plate so that the plate will slide more easily.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate
    If the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate, we can now grip the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the top of the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is closed around the plate, the robot can start pushing the plate toward the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
