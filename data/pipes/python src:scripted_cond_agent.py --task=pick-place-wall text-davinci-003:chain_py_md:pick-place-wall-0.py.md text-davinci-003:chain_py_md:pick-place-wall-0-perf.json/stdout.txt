Then, the code to control the robot should be written:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck, slightly behind wall
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move poked past wall to goal
    # First, put the gripper slightly above the puck, just behind the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind the wall and not above the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck and slightly behind wall")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck past the wall.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("puck past wall to goal")
