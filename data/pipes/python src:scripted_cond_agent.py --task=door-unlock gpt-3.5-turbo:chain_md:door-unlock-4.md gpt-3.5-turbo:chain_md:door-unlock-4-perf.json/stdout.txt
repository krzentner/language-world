To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    
    Steps: 1. Put gripper around the dial of the door  2. Turn the dial to the correct combination

    First, the robot needs to put the gripper around the dial of the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial of the door, the robot should put gripper around the dial.
    Once the gripper is around the dial, the robot needs to turn it to the correct combination.
    - When the dial is not at the correct combination, the robot should turn the dial to the correct combination.
    Keep turning the dial until the correct combination is reached.
