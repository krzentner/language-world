For the `box-close` task, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the box  4. Place the box lid on top of the box  5. Release the gripper and move away from the box 

First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't around the box lid yet, put it around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the box lid, move the gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
Once the gripper is above the box, gently lower the box lid onto the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is not touching the box, move the robot's gripper until the box lid touches the box
Finally, release the gripper and move away from the box.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the box lid, release the gripper and move the robot's gripper away from the box.
