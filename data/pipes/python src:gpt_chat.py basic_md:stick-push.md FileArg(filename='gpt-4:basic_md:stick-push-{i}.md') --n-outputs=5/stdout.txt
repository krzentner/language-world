To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick or the thermos, the robot should move to a position where it can grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not holding the stick and the stick is nearby, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the robot's gripper is not above the thermos and not vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick to a position above the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the thermos and the stick is not touching the thermos, the robot should push the stick against the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is touching the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not located close to the stick, the robot should move towards the stick and grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not positioned above the thermos, the robot should position the gripper above the thermos.
- When the gripper is positioned above the thermos and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos to the target location using the stick.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the stick from its gripper.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the stick is not in front of the thermos and the robot's gripper is not holding the stick, the robot should place the stick in front of the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, the robot should drop the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
- When the stick is near the thermos and the thermos is not near the target location, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's end of the stick is not near the thermos and not near the target location, the robot should position the stick near the thermos.
- When the robot's end of the stick is near the thermos, the robot should move the end of the stick closer to the thermos until it touches the thermos.
- When the end of the stick touches the thermos, the robot should move the end of the stick in the direction of the target location until the thermos reaches the target location.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not holding the stick and the stick is not near the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick but the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick near the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is near the thermos but not touching it, the robot should position the stick to push the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is positioned to push the thermos, the robot should push the thermos to the target location using the stick.
