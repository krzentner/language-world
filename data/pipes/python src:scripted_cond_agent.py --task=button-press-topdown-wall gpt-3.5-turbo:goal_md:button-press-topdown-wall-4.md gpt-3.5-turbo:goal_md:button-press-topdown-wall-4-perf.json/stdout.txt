To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the button with the wall in between  2. Slide the gripper along the wall until it is above the button  3. Push down on the button from the top
    The robot needs to approach the button from an angle and slide along the wall until it is above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button and is not facing the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is facing the wall and is above the button
    Slide the gripper along the wall until it is above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button and the robot's gripper is facing the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    Once the gripper is above the button, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
