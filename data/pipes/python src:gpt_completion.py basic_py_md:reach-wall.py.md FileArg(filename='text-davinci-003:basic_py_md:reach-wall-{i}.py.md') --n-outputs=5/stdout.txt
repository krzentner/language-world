if check("the robots gripper is not above the wall"):
    robot.put("gripper above wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with target"):
    robot.reach("gripper above target")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with target"):
    robot.put("gripper in front of target")
if check("the robot's gripper is not near target"):
    robot.reach("gripper near target")


The code should be:
```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the target"):
        robot.push("gripper over the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is below the target"):
        robot.reach("to the target")
```


Solution:
```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.reach("to near the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the wall"):
        robot.align("with the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is slightly beyond the wall and the robot's gripper is up"):
        robot.move("past the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is past the wall and the robot's gripper is down"):
        robot.reach("over the wall to goal") 
```


Solution:
```
#reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
#def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not facing a short wall"):
        robot.reach("side of wall facing target")
    if check("the robot's gripper is facing a short wall"):
        robot.push("wall away from robot's path")
    if check("the robot's gripper is no longer facing the wall"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```


The program should check for the below conditions and take the corresponding action accordingly:

1. If the robotâ€™s gripper is not above the wall
    - robot.put("gripper above wall")

2. If the robot's gripper is above the wall and is not near the target location
    - robot.reach("to goal")

3. If the robot's gripper is near the target location and the wall is blocking the gripper from reaching the target
    - robot.slide("side-ways to go around wall")
