To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- First, if the window handle is not right of the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left of the window handle.
- Once the gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide the window to the right.
- Finally, if the window is not completely closed, the robot should push the window right harder until it is closed.
