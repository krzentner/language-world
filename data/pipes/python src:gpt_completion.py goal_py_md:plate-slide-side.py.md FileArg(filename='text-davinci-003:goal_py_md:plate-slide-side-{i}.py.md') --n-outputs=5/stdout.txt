Then add the steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Line the plate up with the target location
4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the plate 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
3. Line the plate up with the target location
    if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with target location")
4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")


Steps:
     1. Put gripper above plate
     2. Grab plate with gripper
     3. Line plate up with the target location
     4. Slide plate sideways into target location
