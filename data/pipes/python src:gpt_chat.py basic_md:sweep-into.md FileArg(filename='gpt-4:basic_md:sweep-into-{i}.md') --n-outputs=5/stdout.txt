To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, it should close gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper to the target location while making sure the cube stays gripped.
- When the robot's gripper is over the target location, the robot should release the cube.
To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps for the `sweep-into` task:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not open and not around the cube, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.

- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location while keeping the cube close to the ground.
- When the gripper is above the target location and the gripper is holding the cube, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.

- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the cube towards the target location while maintaining a firm grip on the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the cube to place it at the target location.
To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the cube, the robot should lower the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the cube.
- When the robot holds the cube, the robot should move towards the target location.
- When the robot is near the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and release the cube at the target location.
