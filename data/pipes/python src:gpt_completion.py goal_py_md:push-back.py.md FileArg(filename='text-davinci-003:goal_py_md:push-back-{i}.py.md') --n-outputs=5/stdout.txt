The robot's code should look like this:

```
# push-back: slide the puck backwards to the target location
# def push_back(robot):    
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # We need to put the gripper roughly above the puck before we can start to
    # push it back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # Now that the gripper is roughly above the puck, we can try to push the
    # puck back by trapping it from above. We want the gripper to be roughly
    # around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the puck, just move it above the target
    # location. This should slide the puck back to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Push the gripper into the top of the puck
3. Slide the puck to the goal behind the robot

If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper above the puck:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper is above the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the gripper, move the gripper back behind the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move_gripper("behind the target location")
```


The robot should slide the puck backwards to the target location.

Steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into the bottom of puck
3. Slide puck backwards to the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the puck")

if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("below the puck", close_gripper=True)

if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move_gripper("below the target location")


We need to slide the puck from its current location to the designated target location in the opposite direction. 

Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Push the gripper into the top of the puck
3. Push the puck backwards until it reaches the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")

if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)

if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("towards the target location")

if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")


Steps:
1. Put gripper behind puck
2. Push gripper into the back of puck
3. Slide puck backwards to goal

If the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, move the gripper to behind the puck.
if check("the robot's gripper is not behind puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("behind the puck")

# Push the gripper into the back of the puck to trap it.
if check("the robot's gripper is behind the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)

# Once the puck is trapped, slide it backwards to the target location.
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move_gripper("behind the target location")
