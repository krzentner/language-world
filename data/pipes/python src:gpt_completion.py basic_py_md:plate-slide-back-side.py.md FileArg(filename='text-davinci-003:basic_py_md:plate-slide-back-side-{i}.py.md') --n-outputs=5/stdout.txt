if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper is not around the plate"):
    robot.drop("gripper around plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is around plate and plate is not facing the destination"):
    robot.rotate("plate towards destination")
if check("plate is facing the destination and the robot's gripper is in front of the plate"):
    robot.push("plate sideways to the destination")


Solution:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.place("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not at the goal"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is at the goal"):
        robot.release("plate")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not above plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
if check("the plate is not to the left of the robot's gripper and the plate is not forward aligned with the gripper"):
    robot.grab("plate")
if check("the plate is forward aligned with the gripper and the plate is not way to the right of the target location"):
    robot.move("plate to the right")
if check("the plate is almost way to the right of the target location"):
    robot.slide("plate towards target location")
if check("the plate is near the target location"):
    robot.slide("plate backwards")


Answer:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with goal"):
        robot.align("plate to goal")
    if check("the plate is sideways aligned with goal"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper at the side of the plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
    robot.align("plate horizontally with target location")
if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with target location"):
    robot.slide("plate back sideways")
