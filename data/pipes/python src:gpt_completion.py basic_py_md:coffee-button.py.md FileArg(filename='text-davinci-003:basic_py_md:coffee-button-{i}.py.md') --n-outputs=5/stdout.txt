Your program should look like this:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
    robot.put("gripper above button")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
    robot.push("down on button")


Solution:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the button"):
        robot.push("button")
```


Solution:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the coffee button"):
        robot.put("gripper above coffee button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the coffee button but not vertically aligned with it"):
        robot.align("gripper vertically with coffee button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with coffee button"):
        robot.push("on coffee button")
```


Solution:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the coffee machine button"):
        robot.put("gripper above coffee machine button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the coffee machine button"):
        robot.put("gripper above coffee machine button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the coffee machine button"):
        robot.push("down on coffee machine button")
```
