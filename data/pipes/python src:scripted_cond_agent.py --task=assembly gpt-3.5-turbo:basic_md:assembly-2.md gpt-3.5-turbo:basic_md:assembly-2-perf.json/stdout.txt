To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg, the robot should open gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should close gripper and hold the peg.
- When the robot's grip is holding the peg, the robot should move the gripper towards the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wrench, the robot should open gripper to release the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, the robot should close the gripper and pick up the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should move the gripper towards the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg, the robot should slide the wrench around the peg.
- When the wrench is around the peg, the robot should release the gripper to let go of the wrench.
