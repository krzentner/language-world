To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we do not bump it while trying to grab it.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
2. Move the gripper down and around the puck to pick it up.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is not around the puck, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
3. Close the gripper around the puck to hold it securely.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
4. Move the puck to the target location.
   - When the gripper is closed around the puck and the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should move the puck to the target location.
5. Open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
2. When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
3. If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
4. When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
5. If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
6. When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
7. We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
8. When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to the goal.
9. Once the robot has reached the goal, the gripper should release the puck by opening it.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.

2. Move the gripper down around the puck to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.

3. Close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.

4. Move the puck to the target location.
- When the gripper is above the target location with the puck held in it, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
The robot should perform the following steps to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably:

1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
2. If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
3. If the gripper isn't around the puck, the robot puts it around the puck.
4. If the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
5. If the gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
6. When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to the goal.

Note that this is a combination of the steps for `reach` and `pick-place`, as we need to first move the gripper to the puck and grab it before moving it to the goal.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck: Move the gripper above the puck, so that we don't accidentally hit the puck while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.

2. Drop gripper around puck: Move the gripper down to the level of puck and around the puck. It should now be positioned to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.

3. Close gripper around puck: Close the gripper around the puck to hold it. We may need to adjust the position of the puck to ensure a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.

4. Move puck to goal: Lift the gripper with the puck still held, and move it towards the target location. Release the puck once it is in the desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to goal.

By following these steps, the robot should be able to reliably pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
