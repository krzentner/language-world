    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Push door closed
    First, put the gripper above the door handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the door handle, we should be able to grab the door handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, the robot should push down on door.
