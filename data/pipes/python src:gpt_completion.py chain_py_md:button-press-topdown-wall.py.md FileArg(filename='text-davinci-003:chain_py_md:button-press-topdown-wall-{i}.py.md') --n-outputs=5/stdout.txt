Steps:
1. Find a way to get the gripper above the wall
2. Put the gripper above the button
3. Push down on the button from the top

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
    robot.place("gripper above wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
    robot.place("gripper above button")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the button"):
    robot.push("down on button")


Steps:
1. Put gripper vertically above wall
2. Reach to the button with a slight angle to slide the gripper behind the wall
3. Push down on the button from the top

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper vertically above wall
    #  2. Reach to the button with a slight angle to slide the gripper behind the wall
    #  3. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper vertically above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    # Next, reach to the button with a slight angle to slide the gripper behind the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not behind the wall"):
        robot.reach("to the button with an angle")
    # Now that the gripper is behind the wall and is horizontally alined with the button, we can push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind the wall and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


Then, write the code:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put the gripper above the wall
    # 2. Push the wall out of the way
    # 3. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    # 4. Push down on the button from the top
    # Put the robot's gripper above the wall so that it doesn't get stuck on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    # We can now push the wall out of the way to make space for the gripper to
    # reach the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.push("wall out of way")
    # Once the wall has been pushed out of the way, we can put the gripper above
    # the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


Then the solution:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wall
    #  2. Drop gripper over wall
    #  3. Move gripper right of the button
    #  4. Push down on the button from the top
    # Put the gripper roughly above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above wall"):
        robot.place("gripper above wall")
    # Move the gripper down and right to get over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not over wall and the robot's gripper is below wall"):
        robot.drop("gripper over wall")
    # Move the gripper over to the right of button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the button"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of button")
    # Finally, push down on the button from the top.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


Solution:

```

# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wall
    #  2. Drop gripper around the top of the wall, above the button
    #  3. Push down on the button from above, over the wall
    # Start by putting the gripper above the wall, so that we don't catch the
    # wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    # We need the gripper to be around the top of the wall, so move it up and
    # around the wall until it is above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the top of the wall and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the top of the wall")
    # As long as the button is still left of the robot's gripper, we can press
    # down on the button from above the wall.
    if check("the button is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.push("down on button from above the wall")
