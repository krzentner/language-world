To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Lift the mug off the table  4. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug
    If the mug becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the mug.
    - When mug is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the mug, lift it off the table.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the mug is still on the table, move the robot's gripper up until the mug is lifted off the table
    Once the mug is lifted off the table, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and the mug is off the table, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
