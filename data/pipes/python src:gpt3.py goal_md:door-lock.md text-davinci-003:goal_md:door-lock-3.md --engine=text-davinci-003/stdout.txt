    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the door handle  2. Drop gripper around the door handle  3. Turn the dial
    First, put the gripper above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the door handle
    If the gripper isn't around the door handle, put it around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
