To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the puck, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the puck by opening the gripper.
