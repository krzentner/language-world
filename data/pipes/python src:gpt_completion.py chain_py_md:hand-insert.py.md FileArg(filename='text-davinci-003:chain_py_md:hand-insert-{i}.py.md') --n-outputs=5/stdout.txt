Steps:
  1. Put gripper above puck
  2. Drop gripper around puck
  3. Close gripper around puck
  4. Move puck sideways toward goal

if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck"):
    robot.put("gripper above puck")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around puck")
if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):

if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move("sideways toward goal")


The robot needs to pick up the puck and move it to the target location.

Steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Grab the puck with the gripper
3. Move the puck to the goal

if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck"):
    robot.put("gripper above puck")
if check("the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
    robot.grab("puck")
if check("the robot's gripper is near puck"):
    robot.move("puck to goal")


Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Grab the puck with the gripper
3. Move the puck towards the target location
4. Release the puck at the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
     robot.put("gripper above puck")

if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.grab("puck")

if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move("puck to target location")

if check("the robot's gripper is near target location and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.release("puck at target location")


The robot can insert the puck by picking it up with its gripper and positioning it at the target location.
