    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Push the stick against the thermos to move it  4. Move the thermos to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, examine the angle from which the robot can push the the stick against the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with stick and the stick is not pushing against thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is pushing against the thermos
    As long as the stick looks like it is still pushing against the thermos, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing against the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location with the thermos
