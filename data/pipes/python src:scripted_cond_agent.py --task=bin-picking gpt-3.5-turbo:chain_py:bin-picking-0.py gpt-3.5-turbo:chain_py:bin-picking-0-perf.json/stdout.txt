# Steps:
#  1. Use computer vision to locate the cube
#  2. Move the gripper above the cube
#  3. Grab the cube with the gripper
#  4. Move the gripper to the target bin
#  5. Release the cube into the bin
# We need to use computer vision to locate the cube before we can pick it up.
# Once we locate the cube, we need to move the gripper above it and grab it.
# After grabbing the cube, we need to move the gripper to the target bin and
# release the cube into it.
