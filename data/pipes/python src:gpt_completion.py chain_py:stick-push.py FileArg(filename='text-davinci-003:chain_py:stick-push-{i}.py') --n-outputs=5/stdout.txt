    # Steps:
    #  1. Orient gripper so that it is horizontally aligned with the best place to grab the stick
    #  2. Grasp the stick
    #  3. Put the stick underneath the thermos

    # aligned with the best place to grab the stick.

    # First, put the stick against the back of the thermos.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the stick in front of the thermos

    #  3. Lower the robot's gripper onto the stick
    #  4. Push the stick so that it pushes the thermos to the target location

    #  3. Push the thermos to the target location

    # the thermos.
