To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

  Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle up from the side
  First, put the gripper around the handle.
  - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
  If the gripper is fully around the handle, pull up on the handle from the side.
  - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull handle up from the side.
