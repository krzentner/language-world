    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should reach above the peg and the robot should position the robot's gripper slightly above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should grab the peg by opening the robot's gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the puck is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should bring the peg up to the target location.


The robot should perform the following steps: 
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper down above peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is not near peg, the robot should move the gripper closer to the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is still in hole, the robot should lift peg out of hole.
   - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is above hole, the robot should place peg at goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertical aligned with the peg, the robot should move gripper below the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should move gripper over the peg and close gripper around peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should move the peg to the goal location.


The robot should perform the following steps to pick up the peg out of the hole reliably: 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should place the puck at the goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move gripper to above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower the gripper into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the robot's gripper is not above the goal, the robot should raise gripper above goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the goal, the robot should place the peg at the goal.
