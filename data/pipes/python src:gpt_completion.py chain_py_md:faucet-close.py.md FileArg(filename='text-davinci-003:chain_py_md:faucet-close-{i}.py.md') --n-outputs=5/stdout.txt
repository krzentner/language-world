```
# faucet-close: turn the faucet right
# def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle
    #  2. Rotate the handle to the right
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet handle")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just rotate the handle to the right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("right")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above faucet
  2. Turn faucet to the right

# faucet-close: turn the faucet to the right
# def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above faucet
    #  2. Turn faucet to the right
    # We need to put the gripper above the faucet before we can grab it, because
    # of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet, we should be able to grab
    # the faucet by moving the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet and the robot's gripper is not around faucet"):
        robot.put("gripper around faucet")
    # Try to turn the faucet to the right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around faucet"):
        robot.turn("faucet to the right")


Steps:
  1. Put the gripper above the faucet
  2. Lower the gripper down around the faucet, making sure the gripper is not pressing down too hard
  3. Wind the faucet to the right, making sure to not exert too much pressure
  4. Check that the faucet is in the closed position

Robot Code:
```

    #  2. Lower the gripper down around the faucet, making sure the gripper is not pressing down too hard
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around faucet and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("faucet")
    # 3. Wind the faucet to the right, making sure to not exert too much pressure
    if check("the robot's gripper is around faucet"):
        robot.wind("faucet right")
    #  4. Check that the faucet is in the closed position
    if check("the faucet is not fully closed"):
