The steps of the algorithm are:
  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above 
  2. Put the gripper on the wall above the button 
  3. Push down on the button from the top 

First, the robot needs to get into a position where it is able to reach the button with the wall in the way. We can do this by moving the gripper to the wall above the button.

If the gripper is not near the wall, move it to the wall: 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
```

Then, if the gripper is not above the button when viewed from above, move it to the wall above the button: 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button when viewed from above"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the button when viewed from above")
```

Finally, if the robot's gripper is above the button when viewed from above, we can push down on the button by moving the gripper near the button: 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the button when viewed from above"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the wall and move it forward until the gripper is aligned with the button as seen from above
2. Push down the wall to move it away from the button, until the button is visible
3. Push down on the button from the top

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button as seen from above"):
    robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the wall")
if check("the wall is blocking the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("tilting the wall away from the button",close_gripper=True)
if check("the wall is removed from the button"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")


The steps of the task are as follows:

1. Put gripper above the wall
2. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
3. Push down on the button from the top above the wall

The code would look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wall
    #  2. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  3. Push down on the button from the top above the wall
    # First, put the gripper above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    # Once the gripper is above the wall, line it up as viewed from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```


The steps in the program would be:

1. Put the gripper near the wall
2. Put the gripper around the button
3. Push down the button from the top

# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the wall
    #  2. Put gripper around the button
    #  3. Push down the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper slightly above the wall, so the robot can place one
    # side on the wall and the other side around the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
    # Once the gripper is near the wall, we can put the gripper around
    # the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not around the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the button, we can push it down from the top.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the button")


Here's the code:
```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from slightly above the wall
    #  2. Push down from the top
    # First, line up the gripper from slightly above the wall so that the gripper
    # is lined up with the button from the top.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the button from slightly above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the button from slightly above the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with button from slightly above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
