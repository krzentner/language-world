To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should place the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the plate is not near the target location, the robot should push the gripper into the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the target location.
