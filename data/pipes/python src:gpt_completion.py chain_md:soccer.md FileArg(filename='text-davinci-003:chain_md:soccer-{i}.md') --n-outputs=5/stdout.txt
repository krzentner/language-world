    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the ball  2. Push the door open  3. Push the ball to the goal
    We'll need to line up the gripper with the side of the ball to push it
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not along the side of the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper to side of ball.
    Once the robot's gripper is lined up along the side of the soccer ball, it can push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is along the side of the soccer ball, the robot should push ball towards goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Push down the gripper onto the soccer ball  3. Push the soccer ball to the target 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the soccer ball, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    -When the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around soccer ball.
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around soccer ball.
    We closed the gripper, and the soccer ball is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the soccer ball to the target. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    -When the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push soccer ball to target.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push grip into soccer ball  3. Push soccer ball in chosen direction
    The robotic gripper needs to be lined up above the soccer ball before we can attempt to push the ball into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
    If the gripper is lined up with the soccer ball, we can push the ball using the force of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball, the robot should push grip into soccer ball.
    We've trapped the soccer ball by pushing the gripper into it. Now push the ball into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball in chosen direction.


Steps:  1. Find the ball  2. Put gripper above the ball  3. Push the ball  4. Push the ball to the goal

- When the robot can't see the ball, the robot should find the ball. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should put the gripper above the ball. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball, the robot should push the ball. 
- When the robot's gripper is at or near the ball, the robot should push the ball to the goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper forward-aligned with soccer ball  2. Push soccer ball with gripper  3. Slightly lift gripper off soccer ball  4. Point gripper toward target and slide soccer ball
    First, move the gripper in front of the soccer ball and align it there.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward-aligned with soccer ball, the robot should move gripper in front of the soccer ball.
    We can basically touch the soccer ball with the gripper and push it forward.
    - When robot's gripper is forward-aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is far from soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball with gripper.
    If the robot's gripper is touching the soccer ball, point the gripper slightly up towards the target and slide the soccer ball.
    - When robot's gripper is touching soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not pointing towards the target, the robot should point gripper toward target and lift off soccer ball slightly.
