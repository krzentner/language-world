To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button, near wall  2. Tilt gripper to clear the wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    Because there's a short wall in the way, we need to first put the gripper above the button, as close to the wall as possible.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should put gripper above button, near the wall.
    Then, tilt the gripper to clear the wall and move it closer to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is not vertical, the robot should tilt gripper to clear the wall.
    Finally, push down on the button as usual.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button.
To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above, taking the wall into account  2. Move the gripper over the wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    
    First, line up the gripper as viewed from above, taking the wall into account. The gripper should be positioned to the side of the wall, where it has a clear view of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not positioned above the wall, the robot should put gripper above button from a position that is on the side of the wall.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the button from the side of the wall, move the gripper over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not positioned over the wall, the robot should move gripper over the wall.
    Now that the gripper is above the button and the wall, push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is positioned over the wall and vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button from the top.
To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the robot's gripper directly above the button while also being close to the wall.
2. Move the gripper down until it makes contact with the button.
3. Push down on the button with the gripper while also applying pressure inward towards the wall to prevent the gripper from slipping off the button.
4. Release the gripper from the button and lift the gripper back up.
For the `button-press-topdown-wall` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper above button  2. Move gripper down to the top of the wall  3. Extend the gripper over the wall and push the button down from above
    First, put the gripper above the button as before.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Then, move the gripper down to the top of the wall where the button is located.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on top of the wall and the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should move gripper down to the top of the wall.
    Finally, extend the gripper over the wall and push the button down from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is on top of the wall, the robot should extend gripper over the wall and push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above with button  2. Move gripper forward until it hits the wall  3. Rotate gripper to push button down from above  4. Lift gripper up
    First, line up the robot's gripper from above with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Move the gripper forward until it hits the wall.
    - When the gripper is not hitting the wall and the gripper is above button, the robot should move gripper forward until it hits the wall.
    Rotate the gripper to push the button down from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is hitting the wall and the gripper is not rotated, the robot should rotate gripper to push button down from above.
    Finally, lift the gripper up to release the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is rotated and the gripper is not lifted up, the robot should lift gripper up.
