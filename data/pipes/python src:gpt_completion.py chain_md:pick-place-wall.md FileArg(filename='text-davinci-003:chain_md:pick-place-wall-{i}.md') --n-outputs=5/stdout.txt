    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wall, in front of the puck  2. Drop the gripper in front of the puck  3. Push the puck to the goal  4. Grab the puck with the gripper  5. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the wall, a bit in front of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of puck and the robot's gripper is not above wall, the robot should put gripper above wall.
    Then, drop the gripper just in front of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of puck and the robot's gripper is above wall, the robot should drop gripper in front of puck.
    Now the gripper is over the wall, in front of the puck. Push the puck against the wall, towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of puck and the robot's gripper is above wall, the robot should push puck to goal.
    The puck should now be behind the wall. Grab the puck with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of puck and the puck is behind wall, the robot should grab puck.
    Finally, move the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around puck, the robot should place puck at goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Reach over wall to grab puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    Since there's a wall in the way, we need to put the gripper farther away from the puck â€” maybe to the side or above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Then, the robot should reach around the wall to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is on side of puck, the robot should reach over wall to grab puck.
    Once the robot has the puck, just close the gripper to make sure it keeps a hold on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    Lastly, move the puck to its desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Rotate gripper so that the side of the wall is closest to the side of the gripper  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Push puck to the wall  5. Close gripper around puck  6. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    Now rotate the gripper so that the side of the wall is closest to the side of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not rotationally aligned with the wall and puck, the robot should rotate gripper orienting the side of the wall closest to the gripper.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, put the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is rotationally aligned with the wall and puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should put gripper around puck.
    Close the gripper slightly around the puck and push the puck against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is rotationally aligned with the wall and puck, and the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should push puck to the wall.
    We have a good grip on the puck, so move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is rotationally aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should move puck to the goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck over wall to goal
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Once the gripper is above the puck, try to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck and closed, move the puck around the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck over wall to goal.

Steps:  1. Put gripper over the wall  2. Drop gripper below the wall  3. Move gripper to above puck   4. Drop gripper around puck  5. Close gripper around puck  6. Move puck to goal
The robot should first put the gripper over the wall, so that it won't obstruct the path of the gripper to the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should put gripper above wall.
Once the gripper is above the wall, it should move the gripper below the wall, in order to move to the puck without being obstructed by the wall in front.
- When the robot's gripper is not below wall, the robot should move gripper below wall.
After the gripper is below the wall, it should go to the puck and drop the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper above puck.
Once the gripper is around the puck, close the gripper to trap the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
Finally, move the puck to the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to goal.
