To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, the robot should position gripper above the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the desired direction.
- When the robot reaches the desired position, the robot should release the dial by opening the gripper.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the desired direction.
    - When the desired position on the dial is reached, the robot should release the dial.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move the gripper towards the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and not around the dial, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the gripper in the desired direction to turn the dial to the desired position.
- When the desired position is reached, the robot should close the gripper to hold the dial in place.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
