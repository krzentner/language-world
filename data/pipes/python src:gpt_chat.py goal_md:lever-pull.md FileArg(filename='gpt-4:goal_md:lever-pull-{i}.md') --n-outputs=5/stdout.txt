To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever handle   2. Pull upwards on the lever handle
    First, put the gripper around the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever handle
    Once the gripper is around the lever handle, pull upwards on the lever handle to rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, move the robot's gripper upwards to rotate the lever upwards.
To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the lever  2. Pull the gripper up to rotate the lever up
    First, the robot should move the gripper around the lever to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed.
    Once the gripper is around the lever, the robot should pull it up to rotate the lever up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is closed. Then pull the gripper upward to rotate the lever up.
To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever  2. Pull the lever up
    First, put the gripper around the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not around the lever, grab the lever by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
    Once the gripper is above the lever, pull the lever up to complete the task.
To rotate the lever up, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever handle  2. Pull the gripper up
    First, put the gripper around the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the lever handle, pull it up to rotate the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is open
The robot should perform the following steps to rotate the lever up:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the end of the lever  2. Grab the end of the lever with the gripper  3. Rotate the gripper up to lift the lever
    To start, put the gripper near the end of the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the end of the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the end of the lever
    Once the gripper is near the end of the lever, grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the end of the lever
    Finally, lift the lever by rotating the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the lever is rotated up.
