The code to push the button on the coffee machine would look something like this:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Drop gripper around the button
    #  3. Push the button down
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the button, so that we don't bump it 
    # while trying to push it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # If the gripper isn't around the button, put it around the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around button and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around button")
    # If the gripper is near the button and open, grab it by pushing down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


Here's the solution:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the coffee button
    #  2. Lower the gripper onto the button
    #  3. Press the button
    # First, make sure the gripper is lined up above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with coffee button"):
        robot.put("gripper above coffee button")
    # Once the gripper is aligned with the button, lower it onto the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with coffee button and the robot's gripper is not over button"):
        robot.drop("gripper onto button")
    # If the gripper is now over the button, press the button with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is over button"):
        robot.press("button")
```


This task requires the robot to push a button on a coffee machine.

Steps: 
1. Put the gripper above the button. 
2. Level the gripper with the button. 
3. Push the button.

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above button
    #  2. Line up gripper with button
    #  3. Push the button
    # First, put the gripper above the button, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to press it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # If the gripper isn't lined up with the button, move it to the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.level("the gripper with the button")
    # Once the gripper is lined up with the button, we can just press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("button")
````


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above button
  2. Drop gripper around button
  3. Push down on button

# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above button
    #  2. Drop gripper around button
    #  3. Push down on button
    # Put the gripper in the general area of the button to get it close enough.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # As long as the gripper isn't quite around the button, drop it around the
    # it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around button"):
        robot.drop("gripper around button")
    # Now that the gripper is around the button, press down on it to push the
    # button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around button"):
        robot.push("down on button")


The rest of the program:

```
# Steps:
#  1. Put gripper above button on the coffee machine
#  2. Push down on the button from the top

# First, the gripper needs to line up the button as seen from above.
if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
    robot.put("gripper above the button")
# Once lined up, the gripper should be able to press the button by pushing down on it.
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
    robot.push("down on the button")
```
