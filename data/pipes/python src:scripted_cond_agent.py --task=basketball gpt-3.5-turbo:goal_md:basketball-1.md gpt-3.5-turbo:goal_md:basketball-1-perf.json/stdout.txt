To put the ball into the hoop, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the hoop  4. Release the ball
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the gripper is not around the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    - When the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop
    Once the gripper is above the hoop, release the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is closed, release the ball by opening the gripper.
