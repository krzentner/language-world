To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle from the side  3. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, we need to move the gripper around the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, we can push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put gripper next to the handle  2. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper roughly next to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    Now that the gripper is roughly next to the handle, push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the handle and the robot's gripper is closed.
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Turn gripper to be vertical with handle  3. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    Once the gripper is near the handle, turn the gripper so that it is vertical with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, turn the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now, push down on the handle from the side to complete the task.
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper near the handle, to the side of it  2. Move the gripper towards the handle until the gripper is around it  3. Push down on the handle from the side
First, put the gripper near the handle, to the side of it.
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the gripper towards the handle until the gripper is around it.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper towards the handle until the robot's gripper is around the handle 
Now that the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle from the side
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle on the side  2. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper near the handle on the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle on the side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle on the side
    Now that the gripper is near the handle, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle on the side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle.
