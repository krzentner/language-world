If check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
    robot.move("gripper to left of the plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
    robot.grab("plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is holding the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the goal"):
    robot.align("plate with goal")
if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the goal"):
    robot.slide("plate back")
 

If check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
    robot.slide("the plate back")
if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not in the target location"):
    robot.slide("the plate back harder")


Answer:
```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near target and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("gripper to target")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("the plate back")
```


Solution:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.place("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not near target"):
        robot.slide("plate to target")
    if check("the gripper is around the plate and the plate is near target"):
        robot.release("plate at target")
```


If check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
    robot.reach("to plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not near target"):
    robot.slide("plate to target")
if check("the plate is near the target"):
    robot.slide("plate into target")
