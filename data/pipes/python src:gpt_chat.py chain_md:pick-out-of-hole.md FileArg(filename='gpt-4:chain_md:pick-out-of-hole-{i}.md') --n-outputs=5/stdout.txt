To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Move gripper down into the hole  3. Grab the peg with the gripper  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
    Move the gripper down into the hole to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole, the robot should move gripper down into the hole.
    Grab the peg with the gripper and make sure it has a firm grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside the hole, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper.
    Lift the peg out of the hole and check that the gripper maintains a strong grip on the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper has the peg and is not inside the hole, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
    Move the peg to the target location, making sure the gripper holds onto the peg securely.
    - When the gripper holds the peg securely and the peg is not at the target location, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Align the gripper with the peg  3. Grab the peg with the gripper  4. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
    Check if the gripper is aligned with the peg from above. If it is, move the gripper down to try to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should align the gripper with the peg.
    Close the gripper around the peg to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper.
    Finally, move the peg to the target location while holding it with the gripper.
    - When the peg is picked up with the gripper, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg 2. Grab the top of the peg with the gripper 3. Raise the peg out of the hole 4. Move the peg to the target location 5. Release the gripper to drop the peg in place
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
    Once the gripper is above the peg, grab it from the top with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should grab the top of the peg with the gripper.
    Raise the gripper to lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should raise the gripper to lift the peg out of the hole.
    Move the gripper and the peg to the target location.
    - When the peg is out of the hole and the gripper is holding it, the robot should move the gripper and the peg to the target location.
    Release the gripper to drop the peg in place.
    - When the peg is at the target location, the robot should release the gripper to drop the peg in place.
The task `pick-out-of-hole` may require several attempts to pick up the peg from the hole. The robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Move gripper down and attempt to grab peg  3. If gripper misses, move gripper back above the peg and try again  4. Close gripper around peg once it is grasped  5. Move the peg to the target location
    
First, put the gripper above the peg in the hole. 

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.

Attempt to grab the peg by moving the gripper down to the hole.

- When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is not closed around the peg, the robot should move gripper down and attempt to grab peg.

If the gripper misses, move the gripper back above the peg and try again.

- When the robot's gripper is not closed around the peg and the peg is not grasped, the robot should move gripper back above the peg and try again.

Once the gripper has grasped the peg, close the gripper around it.

- When the robot's gripper is closed around the peg, the robot should hold onto the peg and move it to the target location. 

Finally, move the peg to the target location.

- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the peg is held by the gripper, the robot should release the peg at the target location.
The robot should perform the following steps to complete the task `pick-out-of-hole`:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Lift the peg out of the hole and move it to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the gripper is around the peg, close the gripper to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    Once the peg is grabbed, lift it up and out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should lift it out from the hole.
    Finally, move the peg to the target location.
    - When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move it to the target location.
