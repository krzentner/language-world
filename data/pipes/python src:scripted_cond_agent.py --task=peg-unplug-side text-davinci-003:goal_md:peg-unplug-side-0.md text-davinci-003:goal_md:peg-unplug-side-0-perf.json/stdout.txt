Steps:  1. Put gripper over the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out of the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways to the left
    
Firstly, put the gripper over the peg. 
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
Secondly, if the peg isn't caught by the gripper yet, lower the gripper until the peg is trapped. 
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost closed
Now that the peg is trapped in the gripper, pull the peg out of the hole. 
- When the robot's gripper is almost closed, move the robot's gripper until the peg is no longer near the hole
Finally, slide the peg sideways to the left. 
- When the peg is no longer near the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is left of the robot's gripper
