To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the door handle, the robot should move gripper above the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the door handle, the robot should turn the dial to the correct combination.
- When the dial is turned to the correct combination, the robot should push the door open.
