To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps: 

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around mug handle  2. Lift mug and move it towards goal  3. Place mug at goal
    First, put the gripper around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, the robot should put gripper around the mug handle.
    Once the mug is in the gripper, lift it up and move it towards the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug, the robot should lift the mug and move it towards the goal.
    Finally, place the mug at the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the goal location, the robot should place the mug at the goal location.
