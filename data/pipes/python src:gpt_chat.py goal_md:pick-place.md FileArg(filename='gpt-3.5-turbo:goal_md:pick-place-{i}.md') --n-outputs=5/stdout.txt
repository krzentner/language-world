To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move puck to goal

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck

If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed

If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location.

    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
4. Move the puck to the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck.
2. Move the gripper down around the puck and close the gripper around it.
3. Lift the puck up.
4. Move the gripper to the target location.
5. Move the gripper down to place the puck at the target location and release it.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps: 

1. Put gripper above puck. 
2. Drop gripper around puck. 
3. Close gripper around puck. 
4. Move puck to goal.

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to pick it up. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until it is above the puck.

If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the puck and the gripper is closed. 

If the gripper is near the puck and closed, maybe we can grab it, so check if the gripper is above the puck and closed, then move the gripper to the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and closed, move the robot's gripper until it is near the target location.
The robot for `pick-place` task should perform the following steps:
1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the puck and close the gripper around it to hold it securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Move the puck to the target location by moving the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location.
