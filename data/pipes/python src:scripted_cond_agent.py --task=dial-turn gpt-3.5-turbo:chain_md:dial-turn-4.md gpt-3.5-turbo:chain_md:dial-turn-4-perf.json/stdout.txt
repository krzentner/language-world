To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the dial  2. Grip the dial  3. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper on the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move the gripper to the dial.
    If the gripper isn't gripping the dial, grip the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial and the gripper is not closed, the robot should close the gripper to grip dial.
    Turn the dial until it reaches the desired position.
    - Turn the dial to the desired position.
