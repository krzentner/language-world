    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper roughly above door handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the door handle, it's being opened, so keep pulling.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull door open.
