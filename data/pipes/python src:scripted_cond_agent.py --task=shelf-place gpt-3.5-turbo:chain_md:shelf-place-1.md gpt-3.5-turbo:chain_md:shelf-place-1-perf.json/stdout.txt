To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place gripper above the block.
2. Move the gripper down to the block to pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the block.
3. Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the block, the robot should lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should place the block at the target location by opening the gripper.
