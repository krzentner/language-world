    Steps:  1. Put the gripper in front of the plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Move the plate back to the target location
    First, put the gripper in front of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
    If the plate is forward aligned with the gripper, start pushing the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is just far enough away from the plate so that the plate moves when pushed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is just a little bit farther away from the plate
    If the plate is moving, push it back to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing the plate and the plate is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
