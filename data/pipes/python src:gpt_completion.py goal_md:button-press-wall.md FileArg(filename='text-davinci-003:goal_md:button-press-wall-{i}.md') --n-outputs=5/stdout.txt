    Steps:  1. Move gripper left of the wall  2. Put gripper in front of the button  3. Push button down 
    We'll need to move the robot's gripper around the wall before it can get to the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of wall and the robot's gripper is not near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is near the button
    When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the button, just push the button down

    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of wall  2. Line up the gripper with button, as seen from the side  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the robot's gripper left of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of wall
    Make sure the robot's gripper is lined up with the button as seen from the side.
    - When robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, push down on the button so that it presses.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertical aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper in line with the button  2. Reach around the wall to push the button  3. Push the button
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    If the robot's gripper is roughly aligned with the button and the short wall is still between the robot's gripper and the button, try to reach around the wall to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
    Now that the robot's gripper is close to the button, we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near short wall and forward aligned with button  2. Push button from the front with short wall in the way
    The robot needs to put the gripper as close to the short wall as possible.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is near short wall
    If our gripper is near the short wall, we should be able to press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the short wall and forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button


Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Put gripper against the wall  3. Push the button 
    First, put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    If the gripper is high enough from the button, we can put it against the wall so that it can reach the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not against the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is against the wall
    Once the gripper is pressed against the wall, we can push the button without needing to move the gripper farther away.
    - When the robot's gripper is against the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
