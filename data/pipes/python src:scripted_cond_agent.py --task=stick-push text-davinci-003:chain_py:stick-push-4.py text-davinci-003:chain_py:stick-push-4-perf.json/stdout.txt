    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the stick in front of the thermos

    #  3. Push the thermos to the target location
    # First, put the stick the thermos.

    # the thermos.

    # If the stick isn't pushing against the thermos, reposition the stick
    # roughly above the thermos and then push it into the thermos.

    # Now that the stick is pushing against the thermos, push the thermos to the
