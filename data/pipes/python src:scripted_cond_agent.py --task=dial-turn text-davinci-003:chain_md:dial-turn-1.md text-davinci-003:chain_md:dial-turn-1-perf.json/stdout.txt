    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Grip the dial with gripper  3. Turn dial to goal direction 
    First, put the gripper above the dial to be sure of where it's going to grab.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    Once the gripper is above the dial, it's time to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, the robot should grab dial with gripper. 
    Now that the dial is in the grip, it's time to turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, the robot should turn dial to goal direction.
