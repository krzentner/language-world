To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Lift the cube and move it towards the bin  4. Release the cube into the bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the gripper is above the cube, grab the cube tightly.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Move the gripper up to lift the cube and then move it towards the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the bin
    Once the gripper is above the bin, release the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the bin and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and no longer around the cube.
