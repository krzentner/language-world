To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Move gripper forward to touch wall  3. Slide gripper up and over the wall  4. Push button from the front
    First, put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Move the gripper forward until it touches the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not touching the wall, the robot should move gripper forward to touch wall.
    Slide the gripper up and over the wall. This might require the gripper to be opened slightly.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the wall, the robot should slide gripper up and over the wall.
    Now that the gripper is on the other side of the wall in front of the button, just push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is over the wall and near the button, the robot should push button from the front.
