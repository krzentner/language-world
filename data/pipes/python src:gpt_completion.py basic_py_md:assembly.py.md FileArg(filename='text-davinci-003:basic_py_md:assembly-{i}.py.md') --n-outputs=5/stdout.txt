Your code here:
```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the progress nut is not left of the robot's gripper and the gripper is not forward aligned with the progress nut"):
        robot.align("gripper with progress nut")
    if check("the progress nut is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the wrench is not around the peg"):
        robot.put("wrench around the peg")
    if check("the wrench is now around the peg and the progress nut is far from the progress nut"):
        robot.slide("wrench down the peg")
```


Here's the code to perform the assembly task:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.place("gripper above peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.align("wrench around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
```


Here's the code to perform the 'assembly' task:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.reach("to wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.reach("to peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is not open"):
        robot.open("gripper around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
```


The task to perform is quite specific - the robot must use its gripper to manoeuvre a wrench in order to secure the peg in the hole. With this in mind, the code might look like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the wrench is not above the peg"):
        robot.place("wrench above peg")
    if check("wrench is above peg and the robot's gripper is not around wrench"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not properly aligned with the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench with peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is aligned with peg"):
        robot.insert("wrench around peg")
```
