To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door, the robot should move gripper to the door.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the door knob and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around the door knob.
- When the robot's gripper is around the door knob, the robot should push the door closed towards the target location.
