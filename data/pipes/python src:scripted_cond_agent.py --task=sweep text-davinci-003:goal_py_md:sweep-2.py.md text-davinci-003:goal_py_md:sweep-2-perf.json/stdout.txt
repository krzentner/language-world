# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):

    #  1. Put gripper above the cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around the cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.

     # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
