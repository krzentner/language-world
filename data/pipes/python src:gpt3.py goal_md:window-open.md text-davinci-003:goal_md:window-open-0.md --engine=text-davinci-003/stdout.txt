    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
