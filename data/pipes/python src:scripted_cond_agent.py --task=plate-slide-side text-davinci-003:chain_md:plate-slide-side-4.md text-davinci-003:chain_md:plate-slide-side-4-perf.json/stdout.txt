   Steps:  1. Put gripper over the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate to the target location 
   First, the robot should put the gripper above the plate and make sure it's aligned with the plate from the top-down view. 
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
   If the gripper is above the plate, the robot can grab the plate by moving the gripper around it. 
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the plate.
   Once the gripper has the plate, the robot can slide the plate to the target location. 
   - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide plate to the target location.
