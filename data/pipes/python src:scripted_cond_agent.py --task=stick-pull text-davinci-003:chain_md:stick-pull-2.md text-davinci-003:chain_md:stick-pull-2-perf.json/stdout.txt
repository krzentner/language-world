    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the robot's gripper  3. Move the robot's gripper to near the thermos  4. Place the stick against the thermos and pull the thermos to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the stick to ensure that the robot can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put the gripper above stick.
    If the the stick becomes right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick.
    - When stick is not right of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    Once the stick is grabbed, move the gripper near the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is below the robot's gripper, the robot should put the stick against thermos. 
    Move the robot's gripper back and use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is away from the thermos and the stick is touching the thermos, the robot should pull the thermos using the stick to the target location.
