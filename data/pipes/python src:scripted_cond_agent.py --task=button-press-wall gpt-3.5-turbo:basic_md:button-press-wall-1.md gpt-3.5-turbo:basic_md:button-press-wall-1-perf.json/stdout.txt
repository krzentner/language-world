To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not at the right distance from the button, the robot should move gripper closer to the button while keeping it in front of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is at the right distance from the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper up.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on button. If the wall is too high, the robot may need to adjust the angle of the gripper to avoid hitting the wall.
