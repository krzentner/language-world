To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Close gripper around plate  3. Slide the plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is not closed around the plate, close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the target location, we can slide the plate to the goal. Start sliding it by moving the gripper in the direction of the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
To slide the plate into the target location the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate   2. Push the plate towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate, move it closer.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate, we can slide it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in the target location
To slide the plate into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Move the gripper down and trap the plate between the gripper  3. Slide the plate to the goal location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is open, close it to trap the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is trapped around the plate, we can slide the plate to the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the goal location and the plate is trapped between the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the goal location and release the plate.
To slide the plate into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper lightly against plate to trap it between the gripper and the target location  3. Slide plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate so that we don't bump the plate while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate, move it down to the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is almost closed
    If the gripper is almost closed on the plate, we should be able to slide the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed on the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is trapped between the gripper and the target location
    Now that the plate is trapped between the gripper and the target location, just slide the plate to the target location by moving the gripper.
To slide the plate into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper into top of plate  3. Slide plate to target location
    The robot can slide the plate by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the plate isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, move the gripper down to the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
