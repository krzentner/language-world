# The code defines a function `peg_insert_side` that takes a robot as its argument.
#
# The first `if` statement checks if the gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg.
# If that is the case, it moves the gripper above the peg using the `put` method of the robot.
#
# The second `if` statement checks if the peg is not left of the gripper and is not forward aligned with the gripper.
# If that is the case, it grabs the peg using the `grab` method of the robot.
#
# The third `if` statement checks if the gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole.
# If that is the case, it aligns the peg with the hole using the `align` method of the robot.
#
# The final `if` statement checks if the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole.
# If that is the case, it inserts the peg into the hole using the `insert` method of the robot.
