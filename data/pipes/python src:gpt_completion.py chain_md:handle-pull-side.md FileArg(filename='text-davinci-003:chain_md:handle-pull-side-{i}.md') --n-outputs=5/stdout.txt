    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Wrap the gripper around the handle  3. Pull up the handle
    We need to put the robot's gripper near the handle, so that it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should put gripper near handle.
    As long as the gripper is near the handle, we can grab it by closing the gripper if it isn't already.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is closed, pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull up handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper alongside the handle  2. Pull up on the handle  3. Pull harder until handle is released
    Put the gripper alongside the handle so that the handle is between the gripper and the edge of the surface.
    - When the robot's gripper is not alongside the handle, the robot should put gripper alongside handle.
    If the handle is between the gripper and the edge of the surface, the gripper can pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is alongside the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle.
    If the handle is still connected, pull harder on the handle until it is released.
    - When the robot's gripper is alongside handle and the handle is not released, the robot should pull harder on handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper at the side of the handle 2. Grab handle with gripper 3. Pull up handle
    First, put the gripper somewhere on the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the side of the handle, the robot should put gripper at the side of the handle.
    If the gripper is now at the side of the handle, we can try to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    After we have grabbed the handle, we can now try to pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull up handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Start lifting the handle up 
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should grab handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, start lifting the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should lift up handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near handle  2. Line handle up with gripper as viewed from the side  3. Pull the handle up 
    First, put the gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move the gripper near the handle.
    As long as the handle and gripper are roughly in the same plane, we can align it with the gripper viewing it from the side.
    - When handle is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should put handle in horizontal alignment with gripper. 
    Now that the handle is lined up with the gripper, just start pulling it up.
    - When handle is horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should pull handle.
