I'm sorry, `hand-insert` task is not defined. However, for similar tasks where the robot needs to pick up an object and move it to a target location, the following steps can be performed:

1. Put gripper above the object and open the gripper.
2. Move the gripper down around the object and close the gripper around it.
3. Lift the object up.
4. Move the gripper to the target location.
5. Put gripper down on the target location and release the object.
I'm sorry, but I believe there is some information missing for the `hand-insert` task. Can you please provide more context or details about the task?
It seems like you may have made a typo, as the task `hand-insert` is not defined. Did you perhaps mean `peg-insert-side` or another task? Let me know and I can help provide the steps for that task.
I'm sorry, but I am unable to find a "hand-insert" task in your list. Could you please provide more information or clarify the task name?
I'm sorry, but it seems like there might be some confusion with the task `hand-insert`. Based on the name of the task, it sounds like the robot should be using its own hand or end-effector to insert something into a hole or slot. Can you provide more context or clarification about the task?
