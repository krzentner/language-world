    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push down on the button
    If the button is left of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the button to start pushing.
    - When the button is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the button, the robot should move gripper to in front of the button.
    If the robot's gripper is in front of the button, push down on the button.
    - When robot's gripper is forward aligned to the button, the robot should push down on the button.
