    Steps:  1. Line up the robot's wrist as viewed from the side  2. Place the robot's gripper slightly in front of the wall  3. Push the button from the top
   We need to first line up the robot's wrist from the side so its gripper can reach around the wall.
    - When the robot's wrist is not horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's wrist until the robot's wrist is horizontally aligned with the button
    We need to place the gripper slightly in front of the wall so its gripper can move around it.
    - When the wall is not in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the wall is in front of the robot's gripper
    The gripper should now be ready to push the button from the top. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed

     Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the button at a distance  2. Drop the gripper down while pushing the wall away  3. Push the button down from above
     To avoid getting blocked by the wall, the robot needs to put the gripper at a distance left of the button.
      - When the robot's gripper is not left of the button at a distance, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the button at an appropriate distance
     To avoid hitting the wall while pushing the button, the robot needs to be careful about the direction it moves in.
      - When the robot's gripper is left of the button at a distance and the robot's gripper is not dropping down, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the button at a distance and the robot's gripper is dropping down
    Once the robot's gripper is dropping down, move it until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button

 
Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the wall  2. Move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the short wall  3. Put the robot's gripper above the button  4. Push down the button from the top
    We need to go around the wall to line up the gripper with the button, so put the gripper around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wall
    If the gripper is lined up with the wall, move it above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Now move the gripper above the button so that it's lined up when viewed from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the short wall from the left  2. Line the gripper up with the button from the left  3. Push down on the button from the top
    To push the button down from above with the short wall in the way, we need to first put the gripper around the short wall from the left.
    - When robot's gripper is not around short wall and gripper is not vertically aligned with short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around short wall and gripper is closed
    To reach around the wall, the gripper needs to be lowered and closed. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the button
    Now the gripper is in a comfortable position to the right of the button and the wall, so it can be lined up with the button from the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is still around the short wall
    Now that the gripper is lined up from the left, push down on the button from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is around the short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top, pushing the wall downwards
    We should line the gripper up from above, just like with the other button press task, and then push down on the button against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, push down on the button while pushing the wall downwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the wall is not downwards, move the robot's gripper until the wall is downwards
