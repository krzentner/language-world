    Steps:  1. Put gripper slightly in front of the plate.  2. Line up the plate horizontally with the target.  3. Slide the plate into target location.
    First, the robot puts the gripper slightly in front of the plate to keep it in view. 
    - When the plate is not in front of the robot's gripper, the robot should place gripper in front of plate.
    We have to make sure it is lined up before pushing it, so the robot should align the plate horizontally with the target.
    - When the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should align plate with target location.
    Once the plate is aligned with the target we can just slide it into the target location. 
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate into target location.
