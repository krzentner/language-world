    Steps:  1. Put gripper near faucet handle  2. Start turning the faucet handle left  3. Turn the faucet handle harder
    First, move the robot's gripper near the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle
    If the robot's gripper is lined up with the faucet handle from above, start turning the handle left.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle
    If the faucet handle starts to get harder to turn, push harder on the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle
