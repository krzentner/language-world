To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Pick up hammer by handle  2. Put hammer over the nail head with a good amount of clearance  3. Move hammer downward and hit the nail
    First, position the gripper around the handle of the hammer and pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the hammer and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle of the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, position the hammer over the nail head with enough clearance to swing and hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail with a good amount of clearance, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the nail with a good amount of clearance
    Finally, move the hammer downward and hit the nail.
    - Move the robot's gripper downward until the hammer hits the nail
