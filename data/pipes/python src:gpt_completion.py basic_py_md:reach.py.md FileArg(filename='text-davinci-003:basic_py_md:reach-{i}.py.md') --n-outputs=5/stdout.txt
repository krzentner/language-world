The rest of the program would look like this:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
    robot.reach("to goal")
```


The code below shows how the robot can reach to a target location.

```
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```


Then complete the code:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target"):
        robot.stop("moving")
```


The full code would be:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```


The program should look like this:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```
