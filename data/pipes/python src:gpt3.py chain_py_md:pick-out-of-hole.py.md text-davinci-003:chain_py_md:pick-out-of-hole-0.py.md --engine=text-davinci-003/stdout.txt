Steps:
    1. Put gripper above the hole
    2. Drop gripper around the peg
    3. Close gripper around the peg
    4. Pull the peg out of the hole
    5. Move the peg to the target location

First, put the gripper above the hole so that the gripper is not in the way when we try to pick up the peg.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
    robot.put("gripper above hole")

Then, drop the gripper around the peg so that the gripper can grab the peg.
if check("the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around peg")

Once the gripper is around the peg, we can close the gripper to grab the peg.
if check("the robot's gripper is around peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around peg")

Now that the gripper is holding the peg, we can pull it out of the hole.
if check("the robot's gripper is around peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.pull("peg out of hole")

Finally, we can move the peg to the target location.
if check("the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.place("peg at target location")
