The robot will need to perform the following steps:
1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball
2. Push the soccer ball towards the target

If the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the gripper above it:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
    robot.put("gripper above soccer ball")
```

If the gripper is above the soccer ball, the robot can push it towards the target:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball"):
    robot.push("soccer ball towards target")
```
