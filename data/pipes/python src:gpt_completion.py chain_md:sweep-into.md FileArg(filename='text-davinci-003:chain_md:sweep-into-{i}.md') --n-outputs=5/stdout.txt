Steps: 1. Put the gripper over the cube 2. Drop the gripper onto the cube 3. Close the gripper around the cube 4. Move cube to the goal
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube, and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper onto the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube, and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should move the cube to the goal.
 
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Place gripper around the cube  3. Lift and carry the cube to goal 
    First, move the robot's gripper towards the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, the robot should reach towards cube.
    If the cube is near the gripper, trap it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is closed, lift the cube and move it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the cube is lifted in the gripper, the robot should move cube to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab cube between two fingers  3. Move cube to goal
    We should move the gripper above the cube before grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, we should open it wide enough to grab the cube between two fingers.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not hovering near cube, the robot should grab cube between two fingers.
    If the gripper is in contact with the cube, it's probably grabbing it, so move to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is hovering near cube, the robot should move cube to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube 2. Drop gripper onto cube 3. Lift cube with gripper 4. Move cube to goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    We don't want to accidentally bump the cube, so try to align the gripper with the cube from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper onto cube.
    Once we've dropped the gripper onto the cube, try to lift the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lift cube with gripper.
    We've lifted the cube, so we can move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube to goal.


Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Grab the cube with gripper  3. Slide the cube to the target location
    First, move the gripper towards the cube. 
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, the robot should reach towards the cube.
    When the robot's gripper is near the cube, close the gripper to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the cube.
    If the grip is closed and we've successfully grabbed the cube, slide it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide the cube to the target location.
