    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Put the block on the target location
    The robot can line up the gripper with the block by moving the gripper above the block and move it until the gripper is vertically aligned with the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block 
    If the robot's gripper isn't near the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is not near the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and closed, the robot can move the block to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the block is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
