    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around the faucet handle  3. Turn the faucet left
    The robot couldn't turn the faucet without getting a grip on the handle first, so we need it to try to get a grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle
    With the gripper above the handle, we need to try to get a grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the robot has a grip on the handle, it can try turning the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle
