Steps: 
1. Put gripper above mug
2. Drop gripper around mug
3. Close gripper around mug
4. Pull mug to target location

```

    #  2. Drop gripper around mug
    #  3. Close gripper around mug
    #  4. Pull mug to target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above mug, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.

    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")

Steps to complete `coffee-pull`:
1. Put gripper above the mug
2. Drop gripper around mug
3. Close gripper around mug
4. Move mug to target location

# coffee-pull: grab the mug and pull it to the target location
# def coffee_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the mug
    #  2. Drop gripper around mug
    #  3. Close gripper around mug
    #  4. Move mug to target location
    # Move the robot's gripper above the mug, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the mug")
    # If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the mug", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the mug is controlled by the gripper, move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


Steps:
1. Put gripper above mug handle
2. Drop gripper around mug handle
3. Pull mug to the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the mug handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the mug handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not near target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


Then,

```
# coffee-pull: grab the mug and pull it to the target location
# def coffee_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of mug
    #  2. Grab mug with gripper 
    #  3. Pull mug to the target location
    # First, we want to move the gripper left of the mug, so that we don't
    # accidentally click it while we're trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the mug")
    # If the mug is now left of the robot's gripper, close the gripper around the
    # mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is open and the mug is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the mug", close_gripper=True)
    # Once we have the mug securely in the gripper, we can just pull it to the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")

```


Then, write the following code:

```
# coffee-pull: grab the mug and pull it to the target location
# def coffee_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the mug handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around mug handle
    #  3. Close gripper around mug handle
    #  4. Pull the mug to goal
    # We need to put the gripper roughly above the mug handle before we can grab
    # it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the mug handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the mug handle, we should be able to
    # grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle, and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the mug handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can just pull the mug to the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
