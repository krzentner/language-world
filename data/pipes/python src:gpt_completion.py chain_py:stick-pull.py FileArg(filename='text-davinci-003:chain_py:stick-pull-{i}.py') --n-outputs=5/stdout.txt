    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the forked end of the stick underneath the thermos
    #  2. Push down the stick until it is securely holding the thermos
    #  3. Pull the thermos to the target location
    # First, the robot needs to put the forked end of the stick under the
    # thermos.

    # Once the stick is underneath the thermos, the robot should press down
    #  until it is securely holding the thermos.

    #  3. Pull the stick towards the robot

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near stick handle
    #  2. Put stick handle near thermos
    #  3. Pull the thermos using the stick
    #  4. Pull the thermos using the stick harder
    # First, put the gripper near the stick handle by moving it in the same
    # direction that the stick handle moves when pulled.
