    Steps: 1. Put the robot's gripper just below the wrench  2. Close the robot's gripper around the wrench 3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    The robot should put its gripper below the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wrench
    If the wrench is not below the gripper vertically, move the gripper down until it is. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not below wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is closed, it's ready to be pulled of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is below wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper away from the peg until the robot's gripper is clear of the peg
