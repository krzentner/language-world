Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
This function was already defined above. Did you mean to ask for something else?
I think there's a duplicate function definition here. Do you want me to rewrite this function or do you have a different function in mind?
Oops, it looks like there was a duplicate of a function above. Here's a new function:

# button-press-side: push the button in from the side
# def button_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper next to the button
    # 2. Push gripper into the button to press it
    # First, put the gripper next to the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not next to the button"):
        robot.move("gripper next to button")
    # Once the gripper is next to the button, push it in to press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is next to the button"):
        robot.push("button in")
Oops, it looks like this function was already defined earlier in the code! Here it is again:

# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
This function has already been defined above. Do you need any further assistance?
