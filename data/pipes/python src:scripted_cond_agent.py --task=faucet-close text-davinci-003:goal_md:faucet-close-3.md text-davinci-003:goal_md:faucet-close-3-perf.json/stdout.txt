    Steps:  1. Put gripper over the faucet handle  2. Turn the faucet handle to the right  3. Turn the faucet handle right until closed
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertical aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, turn the faucet handle to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the faucet handle
    We can turn the faucet slowly until the faucet is completely closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the faucet handle and the faucet is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the faucet handle and the faucet is closed
