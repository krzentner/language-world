    Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Pick up the cube with the gripper  3. Reorient the cube for the target bin  4. Place the cube in the target bin
    First, reach towards the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is holding the cube
    Then reorient the cube for the target bin, if necessary
    - When the cube is held by the robot's gripper and the cube is not reoriented for the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the cube is reoriented for the target bin
    Place the cube in the target bin.
    - When the cube is held by the robot's gripper and the cube is reoriented for the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the cube is near the target bin
