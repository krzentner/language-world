To slide the plate back sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper near the edge of the plate  2. Push the plate back into the target location sideways
First, put the gripper near the edge of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the plate, the robot should move gripper near the edge of the plate.
If the gripper is near the edge of the plate, we can slide the plate back into the target location sideways.
- When the robot's gripper is near the edge of the plate, the robot should push the plate back into the target location sideways.
