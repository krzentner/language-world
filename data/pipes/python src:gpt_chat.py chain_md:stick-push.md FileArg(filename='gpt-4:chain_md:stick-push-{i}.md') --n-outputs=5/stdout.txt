To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Position the stick above the thermos and align it with the center of the thermos  4. Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick
    First, position the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick.
    Grab the stick with the gripper and ensure that the gripper's jaw can tightly grip the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the gripper's jaw is not around the stick, the robot should grab the stick.
    Position the stick above the thermos and align it with the center of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not above the thermos or not aligned with the center of the thermos, the robot should position the stick accordingly.
    Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick, while ensuring that the stick maintains a good grip on the thermos.
    - When the stick is above the thermos and aligned with the center of the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Align the end of the stick with the thermos  2. Push the thermos with the stick towards the goal location
First, align the end of the stick with the thermos so that we can push it properly.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick above the thermos.
Once the end of the stick is aligned with the thermos, push it towards the goal location to move the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the thermos, the robot should push the thermos with the stick towards the goal location.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper near the stick: The robot should put the gripper near the stick so that it can pick up the stick.

2. Grab the stick: The robot should grab the stick with the gripper.

3. Position the stick: The robot should position the stick so that it's in a good location to push the thermos towards the target location.

4. Put the gripper near the thermos: The robot should put the gripper near the thermos so that it can push it towards the target location with the stick.

5. Use the stick to push the thermos: The robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location. The robot should push the thermos gently to prevent it from toppling over.

6. Release the stick: The robot should slowly release the stick from its grip after it has completed the task of pushing the thermos to the target location.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Position the stick next to the thermos  2. Push the thermos towards the goal with the stick
    First, position the stick next to the thermos, so that the robot can push the thermos without knocking it over.
    - When the robot's stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick near the thermos.
    Once the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal by using the stick.
    - When the robot's stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal with the stick.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos  4. Push the thermos with the stick towards the goal
    First, put the gripper near the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the stick.
    Once the gripper is near the stick, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
    After grabbing the stick, line it up with the thermos by moving the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is not lined up with the thermos, the robot should align the stick with the thermos.
    Push the thermos towards the goal with the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is aligned with the thermos, the robot should push the thermos with the stick towards the goal.
