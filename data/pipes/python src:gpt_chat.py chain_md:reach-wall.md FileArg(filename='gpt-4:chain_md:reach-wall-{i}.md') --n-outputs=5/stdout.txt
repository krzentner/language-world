To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the robot's gripper is already above the target location.
2. If the gripper is not above the target location, move the gripper towards the target location.
3. If the gripper encounters the wall before reaching the target location, move the gripper up to go over the wall.
4. Move the gripper back down towards the target location.
5. If the gripper encounters the wall again, move the gripper over the wall again and continue moving towards the target location.
6. Once the gripper is above the target location, stop moving and complete the task.
To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the target location is above the short wall. If it is not, move to a location from where the target location is visible.
2. Move to the edge of the wall closest to the target location.
3. Reach over the wall to the target location.
4. If the gripper is not close enough to the target location, move the gripper closer to the target location.
5. Once the gripper is close enough, open the gripper to release any object that may have been picked up during the reach.
To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Move gripper to top of wall  2. Move gripper to target location
First, the robot should move the gripper to the top of the wall to see beyond it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the top of the wall.
Once the robot can see beyond the short wall, it can move the gripper directly to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
To reliably reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the wall is obstructing the robot's path to the target location. 
- If yes, move to the side of the wall where the target location is visible.

2. Move the robot towards the target location. 
- If there are any obstacles in the way, such as the short wall, move around them while still keeping the target location in view.

3. When the robot is close to the target location but the gripper is not near it, reach towards the goal.
- If the gripper touches the wall before reaching the goal, move the gripper to the side without obstructing the view of the target location.

4. Once the gripper is near the target location, the robot can complete the task by either grabbing the object (if there is one) or just stopping near the location.
To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Check if the target location is reachable without crossing the wall.
2. If the target location is reachable, then proceed with the normal `reach` task.
3. If the wall is blocking the path to the target location, move the robot's gripper to a position that allows it to reach over the wall.
4. Once the gripper is over the wall and above the target location, proceed with the normal `reach` task to move the gripper to the target location.
5. Finally, move the gripper back down to the ground to complete the task.
