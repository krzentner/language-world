Steps:  1. Put gripper near the top of the peg  2. Push the peg down with the gripper  3. Grab the peg with the gripper  4. Move the peg to the target location
    Start by positioning the gripper near the top of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the peg, the robot should put gripper near top of peg.
    Then, push the peg down to the bottom of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the top of the peg, the robot should push down on the peg.
    Once the peg is at the bottom of the hole, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg, the robot should grab peg.
    With the peg held in the gripper, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should move peg to target location.
