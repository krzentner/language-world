To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck on the side of the wall opposite the target
We need to put the gripper above the puck, and we also need to make sure the gripper is on the side of the wall opposite the target.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the gripper is not on the correct side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the gripper is on the opposite side of the wall from the target.
2. Grab the puck
Once the gripper is above the puck, we should be able to grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
 - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed.
3. Move the gripper to the other side of the wall
Now that we have the puck, we need to move the gripper to the other side of the wall so that we can place it at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not on the other side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is on the other side of the wall opposite the target.
4. Place the puck at the target location
Finally, we can place the puck at the target location by moving the gripper down and releasing the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is opened to release the puck.
