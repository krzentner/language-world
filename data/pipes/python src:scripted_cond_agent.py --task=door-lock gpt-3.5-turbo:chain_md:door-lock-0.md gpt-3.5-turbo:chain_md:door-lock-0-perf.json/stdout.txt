To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial to the target combination
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should move gripper around the dial.
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the target combination.
    - When the dial is not at the target combination, the robot should turn dial to the combination.
