    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab plate.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location, the robot should align plate to target location.
    If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, insert it.
    - When plate is horizontally aligned with target location, the robot should slide plate into target location.
