    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Slide the stick towards the thermos  4. Pull the stick towards the goal
    First, put the gripper near the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick
    If the gripper is near the stick, grab the stick by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the stick, slide the stick towards the thermos so that the stick is above the thermos before pulling.
    - When the stick is not above the thermos and the thermos is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the stick is above the thermos and the thermos is near the stick
    If the stick is above the thermos and the thermos is near the stick, pull the stick towards the goal to move the thermos.
    - When the thermos is near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
