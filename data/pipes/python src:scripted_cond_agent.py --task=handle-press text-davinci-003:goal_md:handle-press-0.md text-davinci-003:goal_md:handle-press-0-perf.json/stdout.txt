Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Push down on handle  3. Slide handle down
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the handle is not below the robot's gripper, push down the handle to slide it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the handle is not below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is directly above the handle
    If the handle is under the robot's gripper, push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is below the robot's gripper
