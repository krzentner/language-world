To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
Steps: 1. Put the hammer above the nail  2. Move the hammer down to the nail  3. Swing the hammer to hit the nail
First, put the hammer above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.
Next, move the hammer down towards the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is above the nail, the robot should move the hammer down to the nail.
Finally, swing the hammer to hit the nail.
- When the hammer is above the nail and has been moved down to the nail, the robot should swing the hammer to hit the nail.
