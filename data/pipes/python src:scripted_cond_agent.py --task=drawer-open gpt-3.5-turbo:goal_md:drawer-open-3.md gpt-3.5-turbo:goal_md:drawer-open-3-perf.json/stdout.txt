The robot should perform the following steps to pull the drawer open reliably:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.
    - Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle.
