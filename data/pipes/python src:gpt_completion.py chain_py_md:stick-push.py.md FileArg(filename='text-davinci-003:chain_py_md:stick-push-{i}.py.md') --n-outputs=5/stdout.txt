# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the stick
    #  2. Place the stick at the robot's side with the end facing the thermos
    #  3. Retract the stick with the gripper until the stick is at the back of the thermos
    #  4. Push the thermos to the goal
    # First, bring the gripper near the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    # Move the stick to the robot's side so that the end of the stick points
    # toward the thermos
    if check("stick is not at the side of the robot"):
        robot.place("stick to the side")
    # Pull the stick back with the gripper until the stick is at the back of
    # the thermos
    if check("stick is not at the back of the thermos"):
        robot.pull("stick back")
    # The stick is now positioned to push the thermos.
    # Push the thermos forward.
    if check("stick is at the back of the thermos and the robot's gripper is near the stick"):
        robot.push("thermos to goal")


Next, add the steps for performing the task:

```
# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper near the stick 
    # 2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    # 3. Place the end of the stick against the side of the thermos
    # 4. Push the stick against the thermos to move it towards the target location

    # First put the gripper near the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper near the stick")
    # Once the gripper is near the stick, grab it with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    # Place the end of the stick against the side of the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.put("end of the stick against side of the thermos")
    # Push the stick against the thermos to move it towards the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is resting against the thermos"):
        robot.push("stick into thermos and towards goal")
```


The steps would be:

1. Put gripper at the top of the stick 
2. Move the stick to the thermos
3. Push the stick against the thermos to slide it to the target location 

```
# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper at the top of the stick
    #  2. Move the stick to the thermos
    #  3. Push the stick against the thermos to slide it to the target location
    # Place the gripper at the top of the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not at the top of the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper at the top of the stick")
    # Move the stick to the thermos.
    if check("the stick is not near the thermos"):
        robot.move("stick to the thermos")
    # Push the stick against the thermos.
    if check("the stick is near the thermos"):
        robot.push("stick against the thermos")
    # Slide the thermos to the target location.
     if check("thermos is not near target"):
        robot.slide("thermos to the target location")
```


The Steps:
1. Put gripper above the stick 
2. Grab stick with the gripper
3. Position the stick in front of the thermos
4. Push the thermos to the target location

If the gripper is not above the stick, move it there:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
    robot.put("gripper above the stick") 
```

If the stick is not gripped, grab it with the gripper:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not gripping the stick"):
    robot.grab("stick") 
```

If the stick isn't positioned in front of the thermos, line it up:

```
if check("the stick is not forward aligned with the thermos"):
    robot.align("stick to thermos") 
```

Finally, push the thermos to the target location:

```
if check("the stick is forward aligned with thermos"):
    robot.push("thermos to target")
```


Then, proceed with the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the stick
2. Drop the gripper around the stick
3. Close the gripper around the stick
4. Put the stick below the thermos 
5. Push the thermos to the target location 

```
# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps: 
    #  1. Put the gripper above the stick
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the stick
    #  3. Close the gripper around the stick
    #  4. Put the stick below the thermos
    #  5. Push the thermos to the target location
    # Put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.place("gripper above stick")
    # If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around stick")
    # If the gripper is near the stick and open, grab the stick by closing the
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around stick")
    # We closed the gripper, and the stick is still near the gripper, so maybe
    # we grabbed it.
    # Try to move the stick to below the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("stick below thermos")
    # Now that the stick is below the thermos, try to push the thermos to the
    # target location.
    if check("the thermos is above the stick"):
        robot.push("thermos to goal")
