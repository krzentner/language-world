The robot should perform the following steps to insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.


The steps the robot should perform are:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When peg is not side of the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
