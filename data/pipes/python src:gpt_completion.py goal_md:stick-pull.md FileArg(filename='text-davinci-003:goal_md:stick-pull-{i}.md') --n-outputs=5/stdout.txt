    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Slide the stick towards the thermos  4. Pull the stick towards the goal
    First, put the gripper near the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick
    If the gripper is near the stick, grab the stick by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the stick, slide the stick towards the thermos so that the stick is above the thermos before pulling.
    - When the stick is not above the thermos and the thermos is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the stick is above the thermos and the thermos is near the stick
    If the stick is above the thermos and the thermos is near the stick, pull the stick towards the goal to move the thermos.
    - When the thermos is near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Push the stick against the thermos to move it  4. Move the thermos to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, examine the angle from which the robot can push the the stick against the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with stick and the stick is not pushing against thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is pushing against the thermos
    As long as the stick looks like it is still pushing against the thermos, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing against the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location with the thermos

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Pull the stick towards the thermos  4. Push the stick against the thermos to pull it to the target location
    First, put the gripper near the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now, we can use the gripper's force to pull the stick in toward the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now we can push the stick against the thermos to move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Rearrange the stick with the gripper  3. Reposition the stick near the thermos  4. Pull the thermos with the stick
    If the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper to the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick
    
If the robot's gripper is near the stick, rearrange the stick so that it is in the best position for grabbing the thermos.
    - When the robot's stick is malpositioned, move the robot's gripper until the robot's stick is in the optimal position for grabbing the thermos

Next reposition the stick so that it is near the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos

Finally, pull the thermos with the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the robot's stick is not touching the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's stick is touching the thermos
  

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Put the stick against the thermos  4. Pull the thermos with the stick
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
   If the stick is not near the thermos, move the stick towards the thermos by moving the robot's gripper.
   - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos
   If the stick is near the thermos, we can put the stick against the thermos.
   - When the stick is near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is against the thermos
   Now that the stick is against the thermos, just pull the thermos with the stick.
   - When the stick is against the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
