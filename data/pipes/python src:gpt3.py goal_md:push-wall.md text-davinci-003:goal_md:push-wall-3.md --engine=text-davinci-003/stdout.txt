    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Move puck to the side of the wall  4. Slide puck to goal
    We need to move the puck around the wall. First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    Once the gripper is above the puck, we can trap the puck by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck. Now we need to move the puck around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the side of the wall
    Once the gripper is around the wall, we can slide the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
