Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the lever
2. Grab the lever with the gripper
3. Rotate the lever up

If the robot's gripper is not above the lever, move it above the lever.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lever")
```
If the gripper is above the lever but not around it, move the gripper around the lever.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the lever", close_gripper=True)
```
Once the gripper is around the lever, we can rotate the lever up by moving the gripper up.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lever")
```
