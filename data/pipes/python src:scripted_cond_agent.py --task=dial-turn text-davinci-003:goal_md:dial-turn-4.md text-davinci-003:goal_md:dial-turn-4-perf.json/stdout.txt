Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the dial
2. Put gripper around the dial
3. Rotate the dial
- When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial 
- When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial 
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the dial has been rotated to the desired direction
