```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("gripper into the puck and then against the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is pushing the puck against the wall"):
        robot.push("the puck and the wall until the puck is on the other side of the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall and the puck is above the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
