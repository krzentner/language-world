To pick up the box lid and place it on the box, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Move the lid to the top of the box  4. Release the gripper to place the lid on the box
    Start by putting the gripper above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid, the robot should put the gripper above the box lid.
    Once the gripper is above the box lid, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper to grab the box lid.
    Move the box lid to the top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid and is not vertically aligned with the box, the robot should move the lid to the top of the box.
    Finally, release the gripper to place the lid on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid and is vertically aligned with the box, the robot should release the gripper to place the lid on the box.
