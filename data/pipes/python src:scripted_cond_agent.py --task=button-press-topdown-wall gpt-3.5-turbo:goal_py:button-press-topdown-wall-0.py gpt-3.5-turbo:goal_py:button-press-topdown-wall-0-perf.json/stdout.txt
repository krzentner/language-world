# Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper above button but not too high due to wall
    # 2. Move forward until gripper touches the wall
    # 3. Move gripper towards button to press it down
    # Because there's a wall blocking the path, we need to be careful about how
    # we approach the button.
    # First, line up the gripper above the button, but make sure it's not too
    # high to avoid hitting the wall.
