The robot should perform the following steps to pull the door open reliably:
1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
2. Drop the gripper around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
3. Pull open the door.
