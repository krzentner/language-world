To push the door closed reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Push the door closed
    First, put the robot's gripper above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is almost lined up with the door handle, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
