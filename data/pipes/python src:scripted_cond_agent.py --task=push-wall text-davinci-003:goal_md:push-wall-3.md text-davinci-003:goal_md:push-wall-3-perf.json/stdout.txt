    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push puck against wall  3. Slide the puck off the wall and to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the puck so that we don't bump it while trying to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall is not between the robot's gripper and the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the wall is between the gripper and the puck and the gripper isn't near the puck, move the gripper to the side of the wall and push the puck against the wall.
    - When the wall is between the robot's gripper and the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the wall is to the left of the robot's gripper
    If the puck is lined up with the wall, push it past the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the wall is to the left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the goal
