We need to grab the mug and move it to the target location. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Put the gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around mug handle
3. Close gripper around mug handle
4. Move the mug to the goal

If the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, we need to move it above the mug handle:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug handle")
```

Once the gripper is above the mug handle, we need to drop it around the mug handle:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around mug handle")
```

If the gripper is near the mug handle and open, we can grab it by closing the gripper:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near mug handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around mug handle")
```

Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can move the mug to the goal:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug handle"):
        robot.place("mug at goal")
```
