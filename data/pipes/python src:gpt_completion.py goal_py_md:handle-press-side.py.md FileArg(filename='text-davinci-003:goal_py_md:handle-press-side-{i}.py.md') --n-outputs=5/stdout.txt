Steps:
1. Put gripper left of the handle
2. Push down the handle from the side

If the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move it near the handle. We don't need to be careful about direction, since the handle is larger than the gripper.
```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the handle
    #  2. Push down the handle from the side
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
    # If the handle is left of the robot's gripper, just push down the handle.
    if check("the handle is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the handle")


# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Push gripper sideways against handle 
    #  3. Push handle down
    # Put the gripper roughly aligned above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # With the gripper still aligned, move the gripper to the side of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not close to handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("close to handle")
    # Now the gripper should be position correctly to push the handle down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the handle")


Solution:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left/right of the handle
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # To press the handle down from the side, we need to move the gripper to the
    # side of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left/right of the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left/right of the handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up with the handle from the side, just push
    # down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left/right of the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
```


Then write the program: 

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper to the left of the handle
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # First, put the gripper to the left of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the left of the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("to the left of the handle")
    # If the gripper isn't aligned with the handle, line it up from the side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not side-aligned with handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("side-aligned with handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the handle is lined up with the gripper, just push down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is side-aligned with handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the handle")
``


The program should look like this:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle
    #  2. Push against the handle to press it down
    # Put the gripper to the side of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the handle")
    # Now that the gripper is near the handle, we should be able to push against
    # it to press it down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
```
