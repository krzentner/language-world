Solution:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the dial
    #  2. Grab the dial with the gripper
    #  3. Rotate the dial to unlock
    # First, put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    # Once the gripper is lined up, grab the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial"):
        robot.grab("dial")
    # As long as the gripper is still around the dial, rotate the dial to unlock
    if check("the robot's gripper is above dial and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.rotate("dial to unlock")
```


Here's some code that could accomplish the task:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the door dial
    #  2. Lower gripper onto the door dial
    #  3. Turn the dial
    # We need to start by putting the gripper above the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, lower it onto the door dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not above the door dial"):
        robot.drop("gripper onto the door dial")
    # Now the gripper is on the the door dial, it can attempt to turn it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the door dial"):
        robot.turn("door dial")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above door knob
2. Grab door knob
3. Turn the door knob

if check("the robot's gripper is not above door knob"):
  robot.put("gripper above door knob")

if check("the robot's gripper is above door knob and the robot's gripper is not around the door knob"):
 robot.grab("door knob")

if check("the robot's gripper is around door knob"):
 robot.turn("clockwise or counterclockwise")


The program should follow these steps:

1. Put gripper above door handle
2. Drop gripper around door handle
3. Rotate the dial of the door handle

# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around door handle
    #  3. Rotate the dial of the door handle
    # First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    # As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up
    # all the way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    # Rotate the dial until the door unlocks.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.rotate("dial of door handle")


Steps: 
1. Put gripper above doorknob
2. Position gripper around doorknob
3. Turn the dial clockwise

If the robot's gripper is not above the doorknob, move the gripper above it.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the doorknob"):
    robot.put("gripper above doorknob")

Once the gripper is roughly above the doorknob, move it around so it can grip
the doorknob.
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the doorknob"):
    robot.drop("gripper around doorknob")

Once the gripper is around the doorknob, turn the dial clockwise.
if check("the robot's gripper is around the doorknob"):
    robot.turn("dial clockwise")
