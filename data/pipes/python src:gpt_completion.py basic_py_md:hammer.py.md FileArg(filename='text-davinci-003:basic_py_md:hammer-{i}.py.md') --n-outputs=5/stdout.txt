Solution:
```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not close to the hammer"):
        robot.grab("hammer")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the hammer and the robot's gripper is not near the nail"):
        robot.position("gripper near nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the nail"):
        robot.swing("hammer at nail")


Here's the code to do the hammer task: 
```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the nail"):
        robot.place("gripper above the nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the nail"):
        robot.rotate("gripper to horizontally align with the nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is not close to the nail"):
        robot.approach("gripper closer to nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the nail and the gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper on hammer")
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the hammer"):
        robot.hit("nail with hammer")
```


If check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
    robot.put("gripper above hammer")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around hammer and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around hammer")
if check("the robot's gripper is around hammer and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.strike("hammer onto nail")


If check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
    robot.put("gripper above hammer")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail"):
    robot.grab("hammer")
if check("the hammer is above the nail and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the nail"):
    robot.align("hammer to nail")
if check("the hammer is above the nail and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the nail"):
    robot.hit("hammer on nail")
