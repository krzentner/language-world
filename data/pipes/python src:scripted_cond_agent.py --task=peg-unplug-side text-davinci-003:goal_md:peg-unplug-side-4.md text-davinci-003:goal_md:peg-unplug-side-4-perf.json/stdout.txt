Steps: 1. Put gripper slightly to the side of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out of the hole sideways
    To pull the peg out from the side, we first need to move the gripper slightly to the side of the peg.
    When the robot's gripper is not left of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    After we move the gripper slightly to the side of the peg, we can grab the peg with the gripper.
    When the robot's gripper is left of the peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once we grab the peg, we can pull out the peg from the hole sideways. 
    When the robot's gripper is around peg, move the robotâ€™s gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the hole
