The robot should perform the following steps to rotate the lever up:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the end of the lever  2. Grab the end of the lever with the gripper  3. Rotate the gripper up to lift the lever
    To start, put the gripper near the end of the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the end of the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the end of the lever
    Once the gripper is near the end of the lever, grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the end of the lever
    Finally, lift the lever by rotating the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the lever is rotated up.
