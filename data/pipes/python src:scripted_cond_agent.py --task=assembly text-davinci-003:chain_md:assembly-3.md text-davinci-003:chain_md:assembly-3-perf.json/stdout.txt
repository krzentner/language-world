Steps: 1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Line up wrench with peg  4. Close wrench around peg 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, the robot should drop the grip around peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should line up the wrench with the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's wrench is aligned with the peg, the robot should close the wrench around the peg.
