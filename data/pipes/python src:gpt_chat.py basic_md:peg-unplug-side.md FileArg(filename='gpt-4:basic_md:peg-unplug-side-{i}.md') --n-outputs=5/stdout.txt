To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
- When the peg is left of the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper to the right of the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is aligned with the hole, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the peg is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the peg is not to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the peg is not directly above the hole, the robot should move the peg upward.
- When the peg is directly above the hole, the robot should pull the peg out from the hole.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the peg is grabbed and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the peg is not pulled out of the hole, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not pulled out of the hole, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole laterally.
- When the peg is pulled out of the hole, the robot should release the peg.
