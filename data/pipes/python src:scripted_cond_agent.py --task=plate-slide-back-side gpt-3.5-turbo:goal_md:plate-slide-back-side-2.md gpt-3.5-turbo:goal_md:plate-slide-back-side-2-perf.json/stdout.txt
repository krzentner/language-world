To slide the plate back sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate: First, put the gripper roughly above the plate. 

2. Grab the plate with the gripper: Move the gripper down and close it around the plate once the gripper is above the plate.

3. Line the plate up with the target location: Move the gripper to the side of the plate, so that we can slide it back sideways into the target location. 

- When the robot's gripper is not near the side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the side of the plate

4. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location: Once the gripper is to the side of the plate and the plate is lined up with the target location, slide the plate back sideways into the target location.

- When the robot's gripper is lined up with the plate and the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
- Move the gripper horizontally to slide the plate back. 

Note: Be careful not to push too hard and send the plate too far.
