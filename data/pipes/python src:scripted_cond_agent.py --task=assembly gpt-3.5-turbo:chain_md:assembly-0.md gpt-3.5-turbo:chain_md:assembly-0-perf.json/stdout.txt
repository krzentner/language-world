To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put the wrench near the peg  2. Align the opening of the wrench with the peg  3. Move the wrench around the peg
    First, put the wrench near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move the wrench near the peg.
    Align the opening of the wrench with the peg.
    - When the opening of the wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should align the opening of the wrench with the peg.
    Move the wrench around the peg to close around it.
    - When the wrench opening is aligned with the peg, move the wrench around the peg to close it around the peg.
