If check("the robot's gripper is not near the mug"):

If check("the robot's gripper is not around mug"):
    robot.place("gripper around mug")

If check ("the robot's gripper is around mug"):
    robot.push("mug to target")


Solution:
```

        robot.grasp("mug with gripper")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.lift("mug with gripper")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("mug to goal")
