The code for the `faucet-open` task would look something like this:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the faucet handle
    #  2. Grab the faucet handle
    #  3. Turn the faucet handle to the left
  
    # First, move the gripper above the faucet handle to start turning it
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the faucet handle")
        
    # If the gripper is above the faucet handle, we can try to grab the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle"):
        robot.grab("the faucet handle")
    
    # If the gripper is near the faucet handle, we need to start turning it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("the faucet handle to the left")
```


# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle
    #  2. Drop gripper to the faucet handle
    #  3. Turn the faucet to the left
    # First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet handle")
    # As long as the gripper is not wrapped around the handle, close the gripper
    # around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around faucet handle")
    # As long as the gripper is still around the faucet handle, turn it to the
    # left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")


The steps for this task are:

1. Put gripper around faucet handle
2. Turn the faucet to the left

# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper around faucet handle
    #  2. Turn the faucet to the left
    # Put the gripper around the faucet handle in order to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle"):
        robot.grab("faucet handle")
    # If the gripper is still around the faucet handle, turn the faucet handle
    # left to open the faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")


Here's the code:
```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper with faucet
    #  2. Grab the faucet handle
    #  3. Turn the faucet left
    # First, line up the robot's gripper with the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper next to faucet handle")
    # If the gripper is lined up, we can grab the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle"):
        robot.grab("faucet handle")
    # Now that the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can turn the faucet
    # left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```


The code for this program would be:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above faucet handle
    #  2. Grab faucet handle
    #  3. Push the faucet to the left
    # Put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet handle")
    # If the gripper is close to the faucet handle, grab the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle"):
        robot.grab("faucet handle")
    # If the gripper is around the faucet handle, try pushing the faucet to the
    # left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around faucet handle"):
        robot.push("faucet left")
```
