Steps:
1. Put gripper above the handle
2. Line up the gripper vertically with the handle
3. Push the handle downwards

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Line up the gripper vertically with the handle
    #  3. Push the handle downwards
    # If the gripper is not above the handle yet, put the gripper above it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above the handle")
    # If the gripper is above the handle and not vertically aligned, move the
    # gripper vertically.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.align("gripper with handle")
    # After the gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, push down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("handle downwards")
```


Then, our program can look like this: 

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the handle
    #  2. Drop down the gripper around the handle
    #  3. Push down on the handle
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # We can see the handle from above, so if the gripper is near it but not
    # around it, drop the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push down on the
    # handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


The program would look like this:

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Push down the handle
    # We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, 
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to 
    # grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push down on the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the handle
2. Drop the gripper around the handle
3. Push down on the handle

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Push down on handle
    # First, put the gripper roughly above handle, so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # If the gripper is near the handle and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle")
    # We closed the gripper, and the handle is still near the gripper, so maybe
    # we grabbed it.
    # Try to push the handle down.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.push("down on handle")


We'll need to put the gripper near the handle, since it's just pushing down.

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the handle
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # Put the gripper near the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper near the handle")
    # Once the gripper is near the handle, push down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
        robot.push("down on the handle")
```
