Your program should look like this:

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.sweep("cube to goal")
```


Solution:
```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the cube"):
        robot.reach("to cube") 
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube") 
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the cube"):
        robot.lift("cube")
    if check("the cube is above the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move("cube to goal")
```


This code should:

if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube"):
    robot.put("gripper on top of cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not near cube"):
    robot.move("gripper closer to cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.sweep("cube to goal")


Then add the code:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the cube"):
        robot.reach("to the cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the cube is not above the robot's gripper"):
        robot.raise("gripper with cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube"):
        robot.slide("cube to goal")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not near the cube"):
    robot.reach("to cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube"):
    robot.grab("cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the goal"):
    robot.reach("to goal")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal"):
    robot.sweep("cube into goal")
