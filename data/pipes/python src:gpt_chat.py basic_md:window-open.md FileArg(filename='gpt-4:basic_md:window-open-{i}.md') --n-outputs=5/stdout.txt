To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, it should move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
- If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, it should slide the window to the left.
- If the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, it should push the window to the left harder.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and is below the window handle, then move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
2. When the gripper is near the window handle, slide the window to the left.
3. If the gripper is in front of the window handle, push the window left harder.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window left.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window left harder.

To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle and below the window handle. If not, move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
2. When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, start sliding the window to the left.
3. If the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle and the window hasn't fully opened, push harder to slide the window fully open.
