if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button"):

The program should be:

```
# button-press: push the button from the front
# def button_press(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not above button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button"):
        robot.push("button")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not below the button"):
    robot.put("gripper above button")
if check("the robot's gripper is below the button"):
    robot.push("on the button")


if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button"):
    robot.put("gripper in front of the button")
if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button"):
    robot.push("button down")
