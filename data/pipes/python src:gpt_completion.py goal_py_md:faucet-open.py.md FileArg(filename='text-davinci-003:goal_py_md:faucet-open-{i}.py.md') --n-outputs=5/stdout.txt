Then, the program should provide instructions for the robot:
   
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above faucet handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around faucet handle
    #  3. Turn the faucet handle to the left
    # First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the faucet handle")
    # If the gripper isn't around the faucet handle, put it around the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the faucet handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the faucet handle, turn the faucet handle to the left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the faucet handle")


# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the faucet
    #  2. Move the gripper up to the faucet handle
    #  3. Push the faucet handle to the left
    # We need to move the robot's gripper to the left of the faucet handle
    # before we can turn it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the faucet handle")
    # If the faucet handle is left of the robot's gripper, move the gripper
    # up to the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the faucet handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is either above or close to the faucet handle, we can
    # push the handle to the left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle or the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the faucet handle")


The steps are as follows:

1. Put the gripper in front of the faucet handle
2. Grip the handle and turn it counter-clockwise 

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of the faucet handle
    #  2. Grip the handle and turn it counter-clockwise
    if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("in front of the faucet handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is in front of the faucet handle and the gripper is open, 
    # grab the handle to start turning the faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the faucet handle")
    # If the gripper is around the handle and closed, turn the handle 
    # counter-clockwise to start the flow of water.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("turned counter-clockwise")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper in front of faucet
2. Turn the faucet left

If the robot's gripper is not near the faucet, move the gripper near the faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the faucet"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the faucet")

If the gripper is near the faucet, turn the faucet left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the faucet")


The Steps that need to be taken are as follows:

1. Put the gripper above the faucet handle
2. Drop the gripper around the faucet handle 
3. Turn the faucet to the desired direction (in this case, left)

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around the faucet handle 
    #  3. Turn the faucet to the left
    # First, put the gripper mostly above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the faucet handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, we should be able to
    # grab the faucet handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the faucet handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can just turn the faucet 
    # to the left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around faucet handle"):
        robot.turn_gripper("left")
```
