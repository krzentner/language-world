To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should position gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not vertically aligned, the robot should lift the handle up from the side.
