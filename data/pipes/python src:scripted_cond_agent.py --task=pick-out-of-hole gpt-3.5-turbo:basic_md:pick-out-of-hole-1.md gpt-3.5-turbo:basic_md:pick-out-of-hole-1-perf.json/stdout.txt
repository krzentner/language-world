To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should place gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower gripper into the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the peg at the target location.
