if check("the robot's gripper is not near the basketball"):
    robot.move("gripper to ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the basketball and the robot's gripper is not around the basketball"):
    robot.drop("gripper around basketball")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the basketball and the robot's gripper is not near the hoop"):
    robot.move("gripper to hoop")
if check("the basketball is near the hoop and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the basketball and the hoop is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.lift("ball to hoop")
if check("the hoop is above the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.drop("ball into hoop")
 

If check("the robot's gripper is not near the hoop"):
    robot.move("gripper to hoop")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the hoop"):
    robot.grab("the ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is holding the ball"):
    robot.align("gripper to center of hoop")
if check("the robot's gripper is centered with the hoop"):
    robot.throw("ball into hoop")


Then add the following code:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the ball"):
    robot.reach("to ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is not pre-grasped the ball"):
    robot.grasp("the ball")
if check("the robot's gripper has the ball and the hoop is not vertically aligned with the ball"):
    robot.align("hoop with ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the hoop and the hoop is not within its reach"):
    robot.reach("to hoop")
if check("the robot's gripper is within reach of the hoop"):
    robot.release("ball into hoop")
```


Solution:

```
# basketball: put the ball into into the hoop
# def basketball(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the ball"):
        robot.reach("above the ball")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("the ball")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.reach("above the basket")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the hoop and the ball is below the hoop"):
        robot.drop("the ball into the hoop")
```


Then add the following code so that the robot can successfully put the ball into the hoop:
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not directly below the basket"):
        robot.put("gripper below basket")
    if check("the robot's gripper is directly below the basket and the robot's gripper is not near the ball"):
        robot.drop("gripper around ball")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near ball and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the hoop"):
        robot.align("gripper with hoop")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.push("ball into the hoop")
```
