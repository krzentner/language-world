To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the reach target, the robot should navigate to a point next to the wall, but with a clear line of sight to the target.
- When the robot is next to the wall with a clear line of sight to the target, the robot should reach over the wall to grab the target, using its gripper's full range of motion to reach as far as possible.
- When the robot has grabbed the target, it should lift it up and move it over the wall to the target location on the other side of the wall.
- When the robot is over the target location, the robot should lower its gripper to place the target in its designated spot.
