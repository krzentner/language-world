To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    1. Put gripper above the dial
    2. Grab the dial with the gripper
    3. Turn the dial to the required number combination
    4. Release the dial
    
First, move the robot's gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
Next, grip the dial with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the required number combination.
    - When the robot has not turned the dial to the required number combination, turn the dial until the required combination is shown
Finally, release the dial and return the gripper to its original position.
    - Open the gripper around the dial and move the robot's gripper back to its original position.
The task of `door-unlock` requires the robot to turn the dial on the door. To unlock the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
  1. Put gripper around the dial handle
  2. Turn the dial in the clockwise direction until it stops
  3. Turn the handle to open the door

First, put the gripper around the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the dial handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial handle
Once the gripper is around the dial handle, turn the dial in the clockwise direction until it stops.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial handle and the dial is not fully turned in the clockwise direction, rotate the dial handle until the dial stops turning
Now the door should be unlocked. Turn the handle to open the door.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
- Turn the handle to open the door.
I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to give you reliable steps for turning the dial on the door. Can you please provide more details?
The task `door-unlock` can be completed by following these steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the door dial  2. Turn dial to the correct combination  3. Open the door
    First, move the robot's gripper near the door dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is near the dial, we can turn it to enter the correct combination to unlock the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door dial and the robot's gripper is not holding the dial, grab the dial with the gripper and turn it to enter the correct combination
    Once the correct combination has been entered, the door will be unlocked and we can open it.
    - When the door is unlocked, move the robot's gripper to the door handle and open the door.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide the steps for the `door-unlock` task without more information about the door and the dial. Could you please provide more details about the task?
