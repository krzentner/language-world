Actually, there seems to have been a duplicate of the `push` function in the original code. Here's the completed `push` function:

```
def push(robot):
    # Steps: 
    # 1. Put gripper above puck
    # 2. Lower gripper onto puck
    # 3. Move gripper to target location while pushing puck
    # We need to put the gripper above the puck before we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # Once the gripper is above the puck, we can lower it to grab the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is closed around the puck, we can push the puck
    # to the target location while keeping the gripper level.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```

Do you have any other functions you'd like me to help you with?
