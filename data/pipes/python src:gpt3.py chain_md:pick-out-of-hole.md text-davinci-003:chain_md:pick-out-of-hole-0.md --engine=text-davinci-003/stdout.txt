    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Move gripper downward around peg  3. Close gripper around peg  4. Lift peg out of hole  5. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above peg.
    If the gripper is not around the peg, move it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    If the gripper is near the peg and open, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    If the gripper is closed, we should have the peg. Try to lift it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is in hole, the robot should lift peg out of hole.
    We lifted the peg, and the peg is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it.  Now that we have the peg, try to move the peg to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place peg at goal.
