The goal of this program is to move the robot's gripper to the position of the lever and rotate it upwards.

``` 
# Lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever"):
        robot.position("gripper above lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is not left aligned with the lever"):
        robot.move("gripper left of lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the lever"):
        robot.rotate("lever upward")
    ```


Answer:
```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is on the lower side of the lever"):
        robot.grab("lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the lever"):
        robot.pull("lever up")


Solution:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lever and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever"):
        robot.align("gripper horizontally to lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.drop("gripper around lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```


The code should answer this question:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.grab("gripper around lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the lever is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("lever up")
```


The code to complete the task may look like this:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    if check("the lever is forward of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the lever"):
        robot.pull("lever up")
```
