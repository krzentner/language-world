    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Drop gripper around wrench  3. Put wrench around peg  4. Close gripper around wrench
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the wrench, we should be able to grab the wrench by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, we can put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is around the peg
    Once the wrench is around the peg, close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the wrench.
    - When the wrench is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
