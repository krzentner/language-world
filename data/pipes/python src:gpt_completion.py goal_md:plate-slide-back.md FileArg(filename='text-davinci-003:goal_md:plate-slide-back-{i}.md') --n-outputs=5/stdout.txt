    Steps:  1. Put the gripper in front of the plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Move the plate back to the target location
    First, put the gripper in front of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
    If the plate is forward aligned with the gripper, start pushing the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is just far enough away from the plate so that the plate moves when pushed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is just a little bit farther away from the plate
    If the plate is moving, push it back to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing the plate and the plate is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate  3. Slide the plate horizontally back into target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate. This will ensure that the gripper has enough clearance from the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate, close the gripper to make sure we have control of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Drop gripper around the plate  3. Slide the plate back  4. Lift the plate up
    First, put the gripper roughly above plate, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Once the gripper is near the target location and the plate is below the gripper, lift the plate up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the plate is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is higher than the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push the plate backwards 
    We need to put the gripper above the plate before we can slide it back.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the gripper is in the right place, slide the plate back by pushing towards the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is front aligned with the plate

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Put gripper around the plate  3. Slide the plate back into the target location 
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once the robot's gripper is lined up, we can grab the plate by moving the gripper around it. If the plate isn't below the gripper, move the gripper until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    We can now slide the plate back in.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not close to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is near the target location
