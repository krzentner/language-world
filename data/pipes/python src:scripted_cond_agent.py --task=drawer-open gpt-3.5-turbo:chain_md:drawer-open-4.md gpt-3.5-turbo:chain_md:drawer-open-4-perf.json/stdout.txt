I apologize, it seems there has been an error in the task list as `drawer-open` was already listed previously. 

If you meant to ask for the steps to perform the task `drawer-close`, then the robot should perform the following steps: 

1. Put the gripper roughly around the drawer handle 
2. Push the drawer closed 

If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction since we're just pushing the drawer. 

- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move gripper to drawer handle.

If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed. 

- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed.
