    Steps:  1. Put the gripper forward of plate 2. Push the plate back to target location
    Firstly, the robot needs to put the gripper forward of plate.
    -When the robot's gripper is not forward of plate, the robot should move the gripper forward of plate.
    As long as the plate is left of the robot's gripper, start pushing the plate back to the target.
    -When the robot's gripper is forward of plate and the plate is left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push the plate back to target location.
