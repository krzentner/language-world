Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the cube  2. Line up the gripper and cube side by side  3. Grab the cube with the gripper  4. Move the cube to the target location
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
   If the cube is left of the robot's gripper as seen from the front, try to line up the cube and gripper side by side. If the gripper is above the cube, move the gripper down until it is around the cube.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
   Once the gripper is around the cube and horizontally aligned with it, we can grab the cube.
   - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
