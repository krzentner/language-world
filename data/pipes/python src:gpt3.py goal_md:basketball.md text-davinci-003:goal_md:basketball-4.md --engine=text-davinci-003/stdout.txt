    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball  3. Close gripper around the ball  4. Aim the ball towards the hoop  5. Push the ball towards the hoop
    First, put the gripper roughly above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the gripper isn't around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the ball and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hoop
    Now, we should be in a position to aim the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hoop
    Finally, we can push the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hoop
