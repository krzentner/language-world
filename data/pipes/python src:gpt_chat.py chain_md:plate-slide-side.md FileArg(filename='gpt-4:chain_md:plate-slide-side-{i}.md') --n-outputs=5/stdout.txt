The robot should perform the following steps to slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move gripper to side of the plate  4. Move the plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    If the plate isn't grasped by the gripper, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper isn't around the plate, the robot should grab the plate.
    Move the gripper to the side of the plate. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the plate is large and we're just sliding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is not at the side of the plate, the robot should move gripper to side of the plate.
    Slide the plate to the target location. We also don't need to be careful about the direction, since the plate is flat and we're just sliding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the side of the plate and the plate is not at the target location, the robot should slide the plate to the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Align plate with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a flat object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the side instead of around it.
    - When the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the plate is not vertically aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the plate.
    As long the gripper is mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, align the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should align the plate with the target location.
    If the plate is aligned with the target location, slide it sideways into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper towards the target location and align it with the side of the target location  4. Slide the plate towards the target location
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
If the plate isn't in the gripper yet, grab it with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper is not closed around the plate, the robot should grab the plate.
Move the gripper towards the target location, aligning it with the side of the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location and align it with the side of the target location.
Slide the plate towards the target location until it is completely inside the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the side of the target location, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location until it is completely inside the target location.
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Move gripper down towards the plate
3. Place gripper around the plate
4. Move the plate towards the target location
5. If the gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, adjust the grip and verify the plate is still properly positioned
6. When the plate is in the target location, release the grip on the plate 

First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.

Once the gripper is above the plate, move it down towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper down towards the plate.

Place the gripper around the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the plate and the gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around the plate.

Move the plate towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate, the robot should move the plate towards the target location.

If the gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, adjust the grip and verify the plate is still properly positioned.
- When the robot's gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, the robot should adjust the grip on the plate and verify that it is still properly positioned.

When the plate is in the target location, release the grip on the plate.
- When the plate is in the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should release the grip on the plate.
To reliably slide the plate sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate is to the right of the gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left of the plate.
    - When the plate is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper to left of plate.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should align plate to target location.
    If the plate is already horizontally aligned with the target location, slide it into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate into the target location.
