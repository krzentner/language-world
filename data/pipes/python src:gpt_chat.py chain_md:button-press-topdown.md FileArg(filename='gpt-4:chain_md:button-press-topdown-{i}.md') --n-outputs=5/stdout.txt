The robot should perform the following steps to push the button down from above reliably:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.

I'm sorry, it seems like there was an error in the previous task. I'll assume that you meant to ask for the steps for task `button-press-topdown`. To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the button. 
Make sure that the gripper is directly vertical above the button. 
2. Move the gripper straight downwards onto the button. 
Push the gripper straight downwards until the button is fully pressed down.
