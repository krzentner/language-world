To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the gripper is not yet gripping the handle, position the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, just pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is fully pulled up.
