Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the handle as viewed from the side  2. Push down on the handle  3. Move the handle left or right as needed
    First, we need to line up the gripper with the handle as seen from the side, to prevent the handle from slipping off.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper next to handle.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, it can push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle, the robot should push down handle.
    If the handle doesn't slide, it may be blocked, so try pushing the handle left or right until it slides.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the handle is blocked, the robot should move handle left or right.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper beside the handle  2. Push down on the handle
    We need to first put the robot's gripper beside the handle. We don't want to put it above the handle, because pushing down might be harder from that position.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beside the handle, the robot should put gripper beside handle.
    If the handle is below the gripper, push down to press it.
    - When the handle is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push down handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Push gripper into handle from the side  3. Push down handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    As long as the gripper is aligned with the handle, we can move it towards the handle by pushing into it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not above handle, the robot should push gripper into handle from the side.
    Once the gripper is securely against the handle, push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle, the robot should push down handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of handle  2. Push handle down
    First, place the robot's gripper left of the handle.
    - When the handle is right of robot's gripper and robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move gripper to left of handle.
    If the gripper is close to the handle, push it down until it fully depresses.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should push handle down.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Push the handle down from the side 
    First, the robot should move the gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should place the gripper near the handle.
    Now that the gripper is near the handle, press down on the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should push handle down from side.
