The robot should perform the following steps to push the button down from above:
1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
2. Push down on the button from the top

To elaborate on these steps:
- First, the robot needs to position the gripper so that it is directly above the button to be pressed.
- To achieve this, the robot should move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the button.
- Once the gripper is aligned, the robot can close it around the button and press down from above to activate it.
The robot should perform the following steps to push the button down from above reliably:
1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
2. Push down on the button from the top
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button.
The robot should perform the following steps:
    
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    
Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    
Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
