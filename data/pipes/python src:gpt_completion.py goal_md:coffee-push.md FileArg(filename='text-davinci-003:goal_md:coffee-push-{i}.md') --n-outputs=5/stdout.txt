    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Move the mug towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up above the mug, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Now that the robot has the mug, move it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Drop gripper around mug  3. Close the gripper around mug  4. Move the mug to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the mug and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the mug  2. Lift the mug up with the gripper  3. Move the mug to the target location 
    First, we should put the gripper around the mug.
    -When the robot's gripper is not around mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot's gripper is around the mug, lift the mug up with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the mug is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    Last, move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Align the gripper just above the mug  2. Drop the gripper around the mug  3. Close the gripper around the mug  4. Move the mug to target location
    The gripper should first align the gripper just above the mug so that the mug is to the left of the gripper while facing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug and the robot's gripper is aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the robot's gripper is not around the mug, drop the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug
    If the gripper is around the mug, the gripper can close on it and control the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug is below the gripper as seen from above, we have the mug controlled. Now just move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the mug is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Close gripper around mug  3. Move mug to goal
    First, the robot should put the gripper above the mug - when the robot's gripper is not above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug.
    Then, the robot should close the gripper to grab the mug - when the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed.
    Finally, the robot should move the mug to the goal - when the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is not near target location, move the robot's gripper until the mug is near the target location.
