To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate horizontally to the target location
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
If the gripper is not around the plate, grab the plate with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it to the target location.
- When the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Move the gripper to the left or right of the plate, depending on the direction in which it needs to be slid
4. Move the gripper with the plate towards the target location
5. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
6. Release the plate from the gripper

So the detailed steps are as follows:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
- If the plate is not aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper towards the target location
- If the robot's gripper is not left or right of the plate, move the robot's gripper either to the left or right of the plate, depending on the direction in which it needs to be slid
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
- If the plate is not slightly touching the target location but not inside it, move the robot's gripper and plate sideways into the target location
- When the plate is in the target location, release the plate from the gripper by opening the gripper.
Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably:
    
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the plate is not between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate.
    - When the plate is not between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed.
    - When the plate is between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper sideways until the plate reaches the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a large object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When plate is horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with gripper  3. Move plate to target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is not around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the plate, slide the plate sideways into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the target location and then move it sideways to slide the plate into the target location.
