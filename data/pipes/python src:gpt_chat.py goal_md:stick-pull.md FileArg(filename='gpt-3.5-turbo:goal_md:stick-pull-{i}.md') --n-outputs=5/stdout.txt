To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Position the robot's gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the gripper until it's above the stick
2. Grab the stick with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Position the gripper above the thermos without knocking it over.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos and not vertically aligned with the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos and vertically aligned with the thermos
4. Use the stick to hook onto the thermos handle from above.
5. Pull the stick towards the robot to pull the thermos towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until it's above the target location
6. Release the thermos by opening the gripper.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the stick near the thermos
    - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the stick until it's near the thermos
2. Grip the stick around the thermos
    - When the stick is not around the thermos and the stick is near the thermos, grab it around the thermos with the gripper
3. Move the stick in the direction of the target location
    - If the thermos is not aligned with the target location, move the stick in the direction of the target location while keeping the gripper around the thermos
4. Release the grip once the thermos is at the target location
    - When the thermos reaches the target location, release the stick's gripper to drop the thermos at the target location.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper close to the stick handle  2. Grab the stick handle with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos handle  4. Put the gripper around the thermos handle  5. Pull the thermos towards the target location while holding the stick 

First, put the gripper close to the stick handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not close to the stick handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the stick handle
Once the gripper is close to the stick handle, grab the stick handle with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the stick handle and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick handle
Now, line up the stick with the thermos handle.
- When the stick is not aligned with the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper until the stick is aligned with the thermos handle
Once the stick is aligned with the thermos handle, put the gripper around the thermos handle and close it to grip the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the thermos handle but is not around it and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the thermos handle and then close the gripper
Finally, pull the thermos towards the target location while holding the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while holding the stick.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
            3. Put the gripper above the thermos  4. Drop the gripper around the thermos  5. Hold the thermos in place  6. Slide the stick to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    Once the gripper is above the stick, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now put the gripper above the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the thermos, we can hold it in place.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    If the gripper is above the target location, we can slide the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the stick has pulled the thermos to the target location
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Position the gripper near the bottom of the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Move the stick to grab the thermos handle  4. Move the thermos to the target location
First, position the gripper near the bottom of the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the bottom of the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the bottom of the stick
Once the gripper is near the bottom of the stick, close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is open and near the bottom of the stick, close the gripper around the stick
Now, move the stick to grab the thermos handle.
- When the stick is not holding the thermos handle, move the stick until it is holding the thermos handle
Once the stick has a good grip on the thermos handle, move the thermos to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the thermos handle and the thermos is not at the target location, move the thermos to the target location by moving the stick and the gripper.
