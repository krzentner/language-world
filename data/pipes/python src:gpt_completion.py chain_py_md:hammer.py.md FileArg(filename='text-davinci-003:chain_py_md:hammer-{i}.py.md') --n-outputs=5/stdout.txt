Steps:
1. Put gripper above hammer
2. Align gripper with hammer and nail
3. Move gripper down to nail
4. Strike the nail with hammer

if check("the robot's gripper is not above hammer"):
    robot.put("gripper above hammer")
if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with hammer and nail"):
    robot.align("gripper with hammer and nail")
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the nail and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move("gripper down to nail")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the nail and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.strike("nail with hammer")


Here's the program:

```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the hammer
    #  2. Drop gripper around the hammer 
    #  3. Drop gripper around the nail 
    #  4. Move the hammer down and hit the nail
    
    # Put the gripper above the hammer, so that it can grab it without bumping
    # into it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
        robot.put("gripper above hammer")
    # If the gripper is above the hammer but not around it, try to grab the
    # hammer.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is not around the hammer"):
        robot.drop("gripper around hammer")
    # If the gripper is above the nail but not around it, try to grab the nail
    # with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the nail"):
        robot.drop("gripper around nail")
    # If the gripper is around both the hammer and the nail, move the gripper
    # down towards the nail to hit it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the hammer and the robot's gripper is around the nail"):
        robot.move("gripper down and hit nail")
```


The steps for the `hammer` task are:

1. Put gripper above the hammer
2. Grab the hammer with the gripper
3. Move the hammer over the nail
4. Drop the hammer on the nail

The code to perform the task is:

```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the hammer
    #  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper
    #  3. Move the hammer over the nail
    #  4. Drop the hammer on the nail
    # First, put the gripper above the hammer.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
        robot.put("gripper above hammer")
    # As long as the gripper isn't around the hammer, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around hammer and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("hammer")
    # If the hammer is roughly aligned with the nail as seen from above, move
    # the hammer over the nail
    if check("the hammer is aligned with the nail and the hammer is not above the nail"):
        robot.move("hammer above the nail")
    # If the hammer is above the nail, drop it on the nail.
    if check("the hammer is above the nail"):
        robot.drop("hammer on nail")
```


# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hammer
    #  2. Grab hammer with gripper
    #  3. Put gripper above nail
    #  4. Push hammer downward onto nail 
    # First, put the gripper above the hammer to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer"):
        robot.put("gripper above hammer")
    # Now that the gripper is above the hammer, close the gripper
    # to grab the hammer.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("around hammer")
    # Once we have the hammer, put the gripper above the nail.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the robot's gripper is not above nail"):
        robot.put("gripper above nail")
    # Finally, we can use the hammer to hit the nail.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the nail"):
        robot.push("hammer downward onto nail")


The program should look like this:

``` 
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the hammer handle
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the hammer handle
    #  3. Move the robot's arm down towards the nail
    #  4. Hit the nail with the hammer
    # First, put the gripper above the hammer handle so that the robot can grab
    # it and move the arm down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above hammer handle")
    # Now, the gripper is above the hammer handle, so move it around the handle
    # to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around hammer handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the hammer handle, start to lower the arm
    # towards the nail.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the hammer handle and the robot's arm is not close to the nail"):
        robot.move("arm down towards nail")
    # When the arm is close to the nail, start to hit the nail with the hammer.
    if check("the robot's arm is close to the nail"):
        robot.hit("nail with hammer")
```
