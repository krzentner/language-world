    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the plate  2. Slide the plate back and sideways  3. Move the plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper left of the plate before sliding it back.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is left of the gripper, start sliding the plate back.
    - When the plate is left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is slightly in front and right of the plate
    Now that we've started sliding the plate, keep sliding it back by moving the gripper away from the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
