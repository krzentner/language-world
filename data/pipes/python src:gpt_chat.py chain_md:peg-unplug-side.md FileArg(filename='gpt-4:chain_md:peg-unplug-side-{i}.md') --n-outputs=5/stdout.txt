To pull the peg out from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the peg  2. Pull the peg straight out
    First, put the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should move gripper around peg.
    Then, pull the peg straight out.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg straight out.
The robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the peg  2. Pull out the peg sideways
    First, put the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should grab the peg.
    Once the gripper is around the peg, pull the peg sideways to remove it from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg out sideways.
To pull the peg out from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Move the peg out of the hole sideways  4. Pull the peg out of the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the peg, move the peg out of the hole to the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is still in the hole, the robot should move peg out of the hole sideways.
    If the peg is out of the hole, release the grip on the peg to pull it out completely.
    - When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should release the grip on the peg to pull it out completely.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the hole sideways
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above the peg.
    Grab the peg with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the peg.
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull it out sideways from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg out sideways from the hole.
