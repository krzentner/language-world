    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the nail  2. Lower the hammer onto the nail  3. Sweep the hammer towards the nail  4.Strike the nail with the hammer 
    First, put the gripper above the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the nail
    Lower the hammer onto the nail at an angle so that the flat side of the hammer can strike the nail.
    - When the hammer is not above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the flat side of the hammer is above the nail 
    Sweep the hammer downwards and towards the nail.
    - When the flat side of the hammer is not downwards facing and the hammer is not aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the flat side of the hammer is downwards facing and the hammer is aligned with the nail
    Strike the nail with the hammer.
    - When the flat side of the hammer is downwards facing and the hammer is aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is next to the nail

    Steps:  1. Line up the robot's gripper above the nail  2. Drop the hammer's head around the nail  3. Hit the nail with the hammer head.
    We need to line the robot's gripper up with the nail first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above or vertical aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the nail and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the robot's gripper is above the nail, drop the hammer's head around the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail and the hammer head is not around the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer head is around the nail
    Now that the hammer is around the nail, the robot can hit the nail with the hammer head.
    - When the hammer head is around the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail and the robot's gripper is half opened
 
    Steps:  1. Put the hammer near nail  2. Hit the nail with the hammer
    If the hammer is not near the nail, move the robot's gripper near the nail with the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail
    Once the gripper is close enough, tighten the gripper on the handle of the hammer and swing the hammer down towards the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is directly above the nail
    Finally, hit the nail with a sharp and short motion of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is directly above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is forward aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is open

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the hammer handle  2. Lower the gripper onto the hammer handle  3. Grab onto the handle  4. Move the gripper quickly towards the nail and then release the gripper to hit the nail
    First, we need to put the gripper above the hammer handle so we can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the hammer handle, move it down until it grabs it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot can grab the handle, we need to move it quickly towards the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the hammer handle and the hammer is not near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail
    If the nail is almost near the robot's gripper, let go of the gripper to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near nail and the hammer is not in contact with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is in contact with the nail

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hammer  2. Drop gripper around the hammer  3. Swing the hammer downwards onto the nail  4. Pull the hammer back up
    First, put the gripper roughly above the hammer so that it can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer
    If the gripper isn't around the hammer, put it around the hammer. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the hammer
    Now that the gripper is around the hammer, we can swing it downwards to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is vertically aligned with the nail
    After hitting the nail, slowly pull back the hammer, so that we can hammer the nail in securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is above the nail
