Here are the steps the robot should perform to pull the door open reliably:

1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
2. If the gripper isn't almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move it until it is.
3. Once the gripper is almost lined up, close it around the door handle.
4. Pull the door open while the gripper is still around the handle.
The robot should perform the following steps to reliably pull the door open:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the door handle, it's being opened, so keep pulling.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull open the door.

Here are the steps the robot should perform to reliably pull a door open:

1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put the gripper above the door handle.

2. Move the gripper down around the door handle to grab it.
   - As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
   - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the door handle.
