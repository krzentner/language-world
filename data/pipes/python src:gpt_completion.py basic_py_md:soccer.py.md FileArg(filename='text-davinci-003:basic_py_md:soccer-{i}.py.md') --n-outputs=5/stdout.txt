If check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
    robot.put("gripper above the soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the soccer ball"):
    robot.align("gripper with soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball"):
    robot.slide("gripper into soccer ball")
if check("the soccer ball is not near the goal"):
    robot.push("soccer ball to goal")


Here's the code to perform the task:

```
# soccer: push the soccer ball into the target location
# def soccer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
        robot.place("gripper above soccer ball")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around soccer ball")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the soccer ball and the soccer ball is not in range of the goal"):
        robot.push("soccer ball forwards")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the soccer ball and the soccer ball is in range of the goal"):
        robot.release("soccer ball")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
    robot.place("gripper above soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball"):
    robot.push("the gripper into the soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.slide("the soccer ball to the goal")


if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
    robot.place("gripper above soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.push("soccer ball to goal")


If check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
    robot.place("gripper above soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around soccer ball")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the soccer ball and the soccer ball is not near goal"):
    robot.push("soccer ball towards goal")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the soccer ball and the soccer ball is near goal"):
    robot.slide("soccer ball into goal")
