Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
I'm sorry but there isn't enough information about the environment or the robot's capabilities for me to provide you with accurate steps. Could you please provide more details?
To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably for the task `sweep-into`, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Close gripper around the cube  3. Move the cube to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the gripper is above the cube, close the gripper around it to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube, we can just move the gripper with the cube towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube and the cube is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the cube is at the target location.
To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the cube 2. Drop gripper around cube 3. Close the gripper around cube 4. Move the cube to goal 
First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
For the task `sweep-into` where the robot has to grab the cube and move it to the target location, the following steps can be performed:
    
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Move the cube to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and closed, we've probably grabbed the cube and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the cube is not at the target location, move the cube to the target location using the gripper.
Unfortunately, the given task `sweep-into` does not specify what type of objects the robot is dealing with or what actions it needs to perform in order to complete the task. Without more information, it is difficult to provide specific steps for the robot to follow. Can you please provide more details about the task and what the robot needs to do to perform it successfully?
