    Steps:  1. Put gripper on stick  2. Place the tip of the stick near the thermos  3. Pull the thermos with the stick
    First, put the gripper on the stick. We want the stick to be in contact with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the stick, the robot should put gripper on stick.
    Now that the gripper is on the stick we need to place or tip near the thermos to start pulling it.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the stick and the stick is not near thermos, the robot should move stick near thermos.
    Once the tip of the stick is near the thermos, pull the thermos with the stick.
    - When the stick is near the thermos, the robot should pull thermos with stick.
