# bin-picking: pick up the cube and place it in the target bin
# def bin_picking(robot):

# Steps:
#  1. Move the gripper above the cube in the bin
#  2. Close the gripper around the cube

#  5. Move the gripper down to the target bin
#  6. Open the gripper to release the cube
# First, put the gripper roughly above the cube in the bin, so that we don't
# knock it over while trying to grab it.
