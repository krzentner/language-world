    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the ball  2. Push the door open  3. Push the ball to the goal
    We'll need to line up the gripper with the side of the ball to push it
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not along the side of the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper to side of ball.
    Once the robot's gripper is lined up along the side of the soccer ball, it can push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is along the side of the soccer ball, the robot should push ball towards goal.
