    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Drop gripper around the block  3. Close gripper around the block  4. Move block to target location  5. Open gripper at target location 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    If the gripper is near the target location, we can then release the block by opening the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open

    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Put the block on the target location
    The robot can line up the gripper with the block by moving the gripper above the block and move it until the gripper is vertically aligned with the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block 
    If the robot's gripper isn't near the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is not near the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and closed, the robot can move the block to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the block is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Lower the gripper to scoop up the block  3. Move the block to the target location  4. Release the block
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
- When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is open

    Steps:  1. Move gripper above block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Lift block up  5. Move block to target location  6. Lower block until it touches target location
    We need to put the gripper above the block before we can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the the target location
    Once the block is near the target, lift it up and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the block is just above the target location and then lower the block until it is touching the target location.


Steps:  1. Reach towards the block  2. Put gripper around the block  3. Close gripper around the block  4. Move block to the target location
    First, reach towards the block to make sure the robot's gripper is near the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block
    To grasp the block, put the robot's gripper around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is near the block and closed, move the block to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the block is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
