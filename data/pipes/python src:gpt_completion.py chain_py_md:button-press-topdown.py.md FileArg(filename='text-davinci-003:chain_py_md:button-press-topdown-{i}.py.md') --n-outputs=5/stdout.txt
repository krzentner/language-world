The final program should look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


Here's the program:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


The rest of the program should be:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, line up the robot's gripper as viewed from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


The program should be:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


The code should look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
