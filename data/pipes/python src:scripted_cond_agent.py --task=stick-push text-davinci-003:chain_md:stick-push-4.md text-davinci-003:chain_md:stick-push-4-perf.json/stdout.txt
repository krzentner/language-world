Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos  4. Push the thermos to the target location
First, put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
If the stick becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick.
- When the stick is not left of the robot's gripper and the stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the stick.
Once the stick is lined up with the thermos and the gripper is still around the stick, push the thermos to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the thermos is not at the target location, the robot should push the thermos to the target location.
