    # Steps:
    #  1. Determine the shape of the wall
    #  2. If the wall is concave, and the robot's gripper is not against the wall, move the robot's gripper along the wall until it is
    #  3. If the wall is convex, and the robot's gripper is not against the wall, move robot's gripper up, then move along the wall until it is
    # We need to determine the shape of the wall first.
