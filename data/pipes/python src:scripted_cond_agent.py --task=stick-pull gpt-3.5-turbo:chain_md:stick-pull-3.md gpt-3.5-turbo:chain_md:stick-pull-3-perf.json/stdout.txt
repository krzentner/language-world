To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Position the gripper above the stick.
2. Grab the stick with the gripper.
3. Move the stick towards the thermos until it comes in contact with it.
4. Use the stick to hook onto the handle of the thermos.
5. Pull the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
6. Once the thermos reaches the target location, release the stick and drop the thermos.

- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should position gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the stick is not in contact with the thermos, the robot should move stick towards the thermos.
- When the stick comes in contact with the thermos, the robot should use the stick to hook onto the handle of the thermos.
- When the thermos is hooked, the robot should pull the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the stick and drop the thermos.
