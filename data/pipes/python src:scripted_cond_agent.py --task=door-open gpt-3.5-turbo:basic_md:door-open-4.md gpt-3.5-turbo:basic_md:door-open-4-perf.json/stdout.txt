To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put the gripper above the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put the gripper around the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull the door open.
