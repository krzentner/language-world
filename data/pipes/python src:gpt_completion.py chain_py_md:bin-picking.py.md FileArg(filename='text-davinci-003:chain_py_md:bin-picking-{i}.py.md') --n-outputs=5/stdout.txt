1. Reach the target bin: `robot.reach("to target bin")`
2. Line up gripper with the cube: `robot.align("gripper with cube")`
3. Grab the cube: `robot.grab("cube")`
4. Move the cube to the target bin: `robot.place("cube in bin")`


The code should do the following:

1. Put gripper above cube
2. Drop gripper around cube
3. Close gripper around cube
4. Move cube to target bin

# bin-picking: pick up the cube and place it in the target bin
# def bin_picking(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube to target bin
    # First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the cube to the target bin.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around cube and the cube is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.place("cube in target bin")


Steps:
1. Move the gripper above the cube.
2. Drop the gripper around the cube.
3. Close the gripper around the cube.
4. Move the cube above the target bin.
5. Release the cube from the gripper at the top of the bin.

    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):

    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.carry("the cube above the target bin")
    # With the cube at the top of the bin, release the cube from the gripper.
    if check("the cube is above the target bin"):
        robot.release("the cube from the gripper")


Steps:
1. Reach the cube with the gripper.
2. If the cube is not being grasped, close the gripper around the cube.
3. Move towards the bin and lower the cube into it.
4. Once the cube is inside the bin, release the cube from the gripper.

    #  2. If the cube is not being grasped, close the gripper around the cube.

    #  4. Once the cube is inside the bin, release the cube from the gripper.
    if check("the cube is inside the bin"):
        robot.open("gripper around cube")
```


The steps to perform the task would be:

1. Put gripper above cube
2. Drop gripper around cube
3. Close gripper around cube
4. Move cube to target bin
