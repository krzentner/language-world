The program should be as follows: 

```
# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("stick to the goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the thermometer is below the stick"):
        robot.push("stick towards the goal")
```


If check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
    robot.reach("stick")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and stick is not facing thermos"):
    robot.rotate("stick to face thermos")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the stick and stick is facing thermos"):
    robot.push("stick on thermos")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the stick and thermos is not at the target location"):
    robot.push("stick to goal")
