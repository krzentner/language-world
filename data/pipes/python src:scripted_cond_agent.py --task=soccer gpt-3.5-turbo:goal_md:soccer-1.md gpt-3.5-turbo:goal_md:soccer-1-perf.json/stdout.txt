To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball  2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper towards the target location while pushing the soccer ball in front of it  4. Release the soccer ball at the target location
First, we will put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball
If the gripper is not around the soccer ball, then grab the soccer ball with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
Move the gripper towards the target location while pushing the soccer ball in front of it until it reaches the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while pushing the soccer ball
Finally, release the soccer ball at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, release the soccer ball by opening the gripper.
