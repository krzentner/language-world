# Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper above the button, accounting for the wall
    #  2. "Peek" around the wall to make sure gripper is aligned with button
    #  3. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because there is a wall in the way, we need to move the gripper over the
    # wall before we can push the button down.
    # We'll first move the gripper above where the button is and then peek around
    # the wall to make sure the gripper is aligned with the button.

# Steps:

# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Move the gripper to the side to avoid the wall
    #  3. Move the gripper back above the button
    #  4. Push down on the button from the top
