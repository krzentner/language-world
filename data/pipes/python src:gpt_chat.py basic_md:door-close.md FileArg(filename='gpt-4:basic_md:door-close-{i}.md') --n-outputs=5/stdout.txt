Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Sorry, I made a mistake earlier in mentioning the task `door-close`. It seems that the description of the task was missing. 

Assuming that the task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door closed to the target location in a reliable manner, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is below the door handle, the robot should move gripper to right of door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, the robot should put gripper around the door handle with a firm grip.
- When the robot's gripper is around the door handle and the door is not closed, the robot should push the door closed towards the target location using a moderate force. 
- Lastly, when the door is closed, the robot should release the grip of its gripper on the door handle.
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should put the gripper around the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, the robot should push the door closed to the target location.
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door, the robot should move gripper to the door.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the door knob and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around the door knob.
- When the robot's gripper is around the door knob, the robot should push the door closed towards the target location.
I'm sorry, but there are several details that are missing from the task `door-close`. To provide you with reliable steps, I need to know more information about the door and the environment where the robot will operate. For instance, I need to know if the door swings or slides, and if there are any obstacles in the way that might obstruct the robot's movements. Please provide me with more details so that I can assist you better.
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should grab the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is backward aligned with the door handle, the robot should push the door closed.
