Here's the program to perform the `hand-insert` task:

```
# hand-insert: pick up the object and insert it into the hole
# def hand_insert(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the object"):
        robot.place("gripper above object")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the object and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around object")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the hole and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("gripper towards the hole")
    if check("the object is aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is below the hole"):
        robot.lift("the object and insert it into the hole")
```

This program first checks if the gripper is positioned correctly above the object. If not, it places the gripper above the object. Then, it checks if the gripper is already holding the object. If not, it drops the gripper around the object. Once the gripper is holding the object, it moves the gripper towards the hole. Finally, the program checks if the object is lined up with the hole and if the gripper is below the hole. If so, it lifts the object and inserts it into the hole.
