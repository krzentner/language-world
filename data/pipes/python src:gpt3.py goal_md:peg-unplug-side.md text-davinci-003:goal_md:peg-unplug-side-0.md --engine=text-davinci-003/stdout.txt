    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Grip the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out sideways 
    We need to put the gripper above the hole before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up above the hole, we should be able to grab the peg by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can just pull the peg out.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg
