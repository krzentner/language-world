Here are the steps the robot should perform to reliably pull a door open:

1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put the gripper above the door handle.

2. Move the gripper down around the door handle to grab it.
   - As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
   - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the door handle.

3. Once the gripper is around the door handle, pull the door open.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull the door open.
