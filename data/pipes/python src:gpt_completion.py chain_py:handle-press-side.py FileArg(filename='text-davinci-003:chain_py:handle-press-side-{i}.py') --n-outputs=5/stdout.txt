    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the handle
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # We need to put the gripper left of the handle before pushing it.
    # This is so the robot can push down on the handle from the side.

    # Once the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the side
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # Because this is "side", we just need to line up the gripper from the side.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from the side.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper from the side
    #  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    # First, line up the robot's gripper from the side by moving it so it
    # becomes parallel with the handle.
    # Note that we don't need to line up the robot's gripper with the handle
    # down to the millimeter.

    # push down on the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is side aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down handle")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # To press the handle from the side, we need to move the robot's gripper to the side of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper to the side of the handle")
    # Now that the gripper is near the handle, we can press down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontal aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on the handle")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly above the handle
    #  2. Move the gripper right so that it is lined up with the handle
    #  3. Push down on the handle
    # First, we need to put the activator roughly above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # If the gripper is currently above the handle, line it up with the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not right of the handle"):

    # When it's lined up, push down on the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
