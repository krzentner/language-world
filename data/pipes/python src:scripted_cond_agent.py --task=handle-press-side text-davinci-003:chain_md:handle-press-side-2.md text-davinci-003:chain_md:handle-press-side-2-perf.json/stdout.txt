    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Push gripper into handle from the side  3. Push down handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    As long as the gripper is aligned with the handle, we can move it towards the handle by pushing into it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not above handle, the robot should push gripper into handle from the side.
    Once the gripper is securely against the handle, push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle, the robot should push down handle.
