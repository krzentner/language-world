To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above hammer handle  2. Grab the hammer  3. Position the hammer above the nail  4. Swing the hammer to hit the nail
    First, put the gripper above the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, we need to grab the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we have the hammer, position it above the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is above the nail
    Finally, swing the hammer to hit the nail.
    - When the hammer is above the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail
