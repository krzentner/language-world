# Steps:
    #  1. Use camera to determine location of cube
    #  2. Move gripper above cube
    #  3. Grab cube with gripper
    #  4. Use camera to determine location of target bin
    #  5. Move gripper above target bin
    #  6. Release cube into target bin
    # We can use the camera to determine the location of the cube and target bin.
    # First, move the gripper above the cube.
