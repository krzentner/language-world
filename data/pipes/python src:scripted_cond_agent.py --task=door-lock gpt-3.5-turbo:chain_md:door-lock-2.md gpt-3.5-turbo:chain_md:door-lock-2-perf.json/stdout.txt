To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial  2. Turn dial to the desired combination
    First, put the gripper around the dial and make sure it's gripped firmly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    Turn the dial to the desired combination by rotating it in the correct direction(s) and number of clicks.
    - When the dial is not set to the desired combination, the robot should turn the dial to the desired combination.
