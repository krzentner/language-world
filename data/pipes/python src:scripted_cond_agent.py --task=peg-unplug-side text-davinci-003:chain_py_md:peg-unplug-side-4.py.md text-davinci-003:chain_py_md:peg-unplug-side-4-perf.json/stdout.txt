The rest of the program would look like this:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the gripper isn't around the peg, start to line up the gripper with
    # the peg by moving the gripper to the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg, line up the peg 
    # with the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole"):
        robot.align("peg to hole")
    # If the peg is lined up with the hole on the left side or right side, 
    # pull the peg out.
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.pull("away from hole")
