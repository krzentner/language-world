# Steps:
    #  1. Put the stick's end near the thermos

    # First, position the stick's end near the thermos.

# 1. Put one end of the stick next to the thermos
# 2. Push the other end of the stick to slide the thermos to the target location
# We'll start by putting one end of the stick next to the thermos.

#  2. Push the other end of the stick to slide the thermos

    # We can position the stick by moving the robot's gripper and arm to place it
    # in front of the thermos at the right angle.

# Steps:
#  1. Put the gripper above the stick
#  2. Open the gripper and grab the stick
#  3. Place the gripper near the thermos
#  4. Push the thermos with the stick towards the target
# First, put the gripper above the stick.
