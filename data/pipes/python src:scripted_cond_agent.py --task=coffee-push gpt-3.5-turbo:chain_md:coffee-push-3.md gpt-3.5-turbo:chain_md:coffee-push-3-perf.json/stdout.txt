To grab the mug and move it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle of the mug. 2. Drop gripper around the handle of the mug. 3. Close gripper around the handle of the mug. 4. Lift up the mug. 5. Move the mug to the target location. 6. Put the mug down.

First, the robot should put its gripper above the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the handle of the mug, the robot should place its gripper above the handle of the mug.

Next, the robot should drop its gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should drop its gripper around the handle of the mug.

Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle of the mug.

After the robot has a good grip on the mug, it should lift it up.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle of the mug, the robot should lift up the mug.

The robot should then move the mug to the target location.
- When the robot has lifted up the mug, the robot should move it to the target location.

Finally, the robot should put the mug down at the target location.
- When the robot has moved the mug to the target location, the robot should put the mug down.
