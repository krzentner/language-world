The robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should move gripper above puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should move gripper near puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
   - When the gripper is closed around the puck and the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should navigate around the wall to the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should place puck at goal.
