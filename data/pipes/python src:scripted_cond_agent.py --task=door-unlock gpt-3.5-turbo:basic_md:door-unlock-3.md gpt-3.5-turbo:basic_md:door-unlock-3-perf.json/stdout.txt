To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial to the correct combination.
    - When the door is unlocked, the robot should release the dial and open the door.
