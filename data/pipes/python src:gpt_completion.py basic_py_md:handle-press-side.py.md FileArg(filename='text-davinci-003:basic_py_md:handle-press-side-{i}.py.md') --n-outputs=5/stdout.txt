The program should look like this:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the left of the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


Then add your code to complete the task:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper near handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle"):
        robot.align("the gripper with the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle"):
    robot.put("gripper to the side of the handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
    robot.move("the gripper closer to the handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
    robot.put("gripper above the handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
    robot.push("down on the handle")


It should look like this:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper near handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with handle"):
        robot.align("gripper with handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with handle"):
        robot.push("handle down")
```


Then write the code:

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, and the robot's gripper is not near handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to side of handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```
