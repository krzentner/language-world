To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following step:

- When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.
When performing the `reach` task, the robot should reach to the target location if its gripper is not near the target location. So the steps to be followed are:

- Check if the gripper is near the target location.
- If the gripper is not near the target location, move the robot arm to reach the target location.
When the robot's gripper is not near the reach target, the robot should reach to the goal.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following step: 

When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.
When performing the task `reach`, the robot should implement the following steps:
- Check if the robot's gripper is near the target location. If the gripper is not close to the target location, then move the robot's gripper towards the target location until it is close to the target location. 
- Once the gripper is close to the target location, the robot should stop moving and the task is completed.
