    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Angle gripper towards the wall  4. Slide the puck towards the wall  5. Push the puck towards target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    If the gripper is not near the puck, move it down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should the close gripper around the puck.
    Angle the gripper in such a way that the wall will be in the way when the gripper slides the puck.
    - When the gripper is above the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should angle gripper towards wall.
    Slide the puck towards the wall, pushing it slightly against the wall.
    - When the puck is near the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide puck towards wall.
    Now push the puck towards the target location
    - When the puck is parallel to the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push puck towards target location.
