To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not positioned at the dial, the robot should move the gripper to the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is positioned at the dial and the dial is locked, the robot should turn the dial in the correct direction and by the correct amount to unlock it.
- When the dial is unlocked, the robot should stop turning the dial and move the gripper away from the dial.
To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial, the robot should move the gripper above the dial.
- When the gripper is aligned with the dial, the robot should close the gripper around the dial.
- When the gripper has a firm grip on the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the correct direction to unlock the door.
