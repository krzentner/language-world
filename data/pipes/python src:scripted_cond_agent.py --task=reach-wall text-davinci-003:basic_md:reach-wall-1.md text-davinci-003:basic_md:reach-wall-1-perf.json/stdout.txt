    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall edge and the robot's gripper is not facing the wall, the robot should move gripper towards the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is facing the wall, the robot should rotate gripper to make sure it is horizontally aligned with the wall edge.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wall edge, the robot should move the gripper forward until it is near the target location.
