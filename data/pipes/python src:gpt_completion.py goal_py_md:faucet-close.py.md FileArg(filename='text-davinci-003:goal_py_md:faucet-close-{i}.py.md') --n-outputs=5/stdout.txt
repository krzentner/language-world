The robot should turn the faucet clockwise (right) to close the faucet.

```
# faucet-close: turn the faucet right
# def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle of faucet
    #  2. Drop the gripper to hold the handle
    #  3. Push the handle right to close the faucet
    # First, put the gripper above the handle of the faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the robot's gripper is lined up with the handle but not near it, drop
    # the gripper to hold the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, push the handle right to close the
    # faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is not right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the handle")
```


Then add the code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the faucet handle
    #  2. Grip the faucet handle with the gripper
    #  3. Push the handle to the right
    # First, make sure the gripper is to the left of the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the faucet handle")
    # Once the gripper is to the left, close the gripper to hold the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the faucet handle", close_gripper=True)
    # With the gripper closed, push the handle to the right to turn it off.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the faucet handle")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above faucet handle
2. Grab faucet handle with the gripper
3. Start turning the faucet right to close it
4. Turn the faucet harder to close it

```
# faucet-close: turn the faucet right
# def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above faucet handle
    #  2. Grab faucet handle with the gripper
    #  3. Start turning the faucet right to close it
    #  4. turn the faucet harder to close it
    # First, we need to the put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the faucet handle")
    # If we've got the gripper above the faucet handle, grab it by moving the
    # gripper around it and closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the faucet handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is above the handle and grabbing it, we can start to
    # turn the faucet right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the faucet handle")
    # Once the faucet is lined up, we have to push a bit harder to turn it all
    # the way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("behind the faucet handle")
```


Solution:

```
# faucet-close: turn the faucet right
# def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above faucet handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around faucet handle
    #  3. Turn faucet right
    # First, put the gripper above the faucet handle before we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the faucet handle")
    # If the faucet is not near the gripper, move the gripper to be near the
    # faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the faucet handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, we should be able to
    # grab the faucet handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the faucet handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can just turn the faucet
    # right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the faucet handle")
```


Then continue by writing code:

```
# faucet-close: turn the faucet right
# def faucet_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above faucet
    #  2. Drop gripper around the faucet handle
    #  3. Turn the faucet handle to the right
    # First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the faucet"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the faucet")
    # If the gripper isn't around the faucet, put it around the faucet.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around faucet and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the faucet", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the faucet and open, close the gripper so that we
    # have control of the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the faucet")
    # Once we're lined up with the faucet, rotate it to the right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of the faucet"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the faucet handle")
```
