Steps:
1. Put gripper above and slightly to the left of pin
2. Drop gripper around the pin
3. Push pin to the left by gently pushing on the left side of the pin
4. Lift pin out of hole
5. Move pin to target location

If the robot's gripper is not almost above and slightly to the left of the pin, move it there.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not almost above and slightly to the left of the pin"):
    robot.move_gripper("almost above and slightly to the left of the pin")
```

If the robot's gripper is almost above and slightly to the left of the pin, but not around it, move it around the pin.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is almost above and slightly to the left of the pin and the robot's gripper is not around the pin"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the pin", close_gripper=True)
```

If the robot's gripper is around the pin, push the pin to the left.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is almost above and slightly to the left of the pin and the robot's gripper is around the pin"):
    robot.move_gripper("to the left of the hole")
```

If the pin is off to the left of the hole, lift it out of the hole.
```
if check("the pin is to the left of the hole"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the pin")
```

Finally, move the pin to the target location.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the pin"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Move the gripper slightly above the hole
2. Lower the gripper into the hole, making sure to grip the peg at the top
3. Move the gripper back up, still holding onto the peg
4. Move the gripper to the target location

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
#def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper slightly above the hole
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the hole")
    #  2. Lower the gripper into the hole, making sure to grip the peg at the top
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("into the hole")
    #  3. Move the gripper back up, still holding onto the peg
    if check("the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("upwards", close_gripper=True)
    #  4. Move the gripper to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is upwards and the peg is held in the gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("at the target location")
```


We will use the same process for this task as for the `peg-insert-side` task. 

# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Pull the peg out of the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg is not lined
    # up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole and the peg is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the hole")
    # Finally, when the peg is in line with the hole, move it out of the hole by
    # pulling the peg to the left.
    if check("the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole and the peg is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the hole")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above hole
  2. Drop gripper around peg
  3. Close gripper around peg
  4. Pull peg out of hole
  5. Move peg to goal

First, put the gripper roughly above the hole, so that we don't bump the peg while trying to grab it.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the hole")

If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg and close the gripper to grab it.
if check("the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the peg", close_gripper=True)

Because the peg is stuck in the hole, it's important that the gripper is placed on the right side of the peg, so that the gripper can pull the peg out of the hole. 
if check("the robot's gripper is around peg, but not on the right side of the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("right side of the peg")

Now that the gripper is on the right side of the peg, we can pull the peg out of the hole by moving the gripper slightly up.
if check("the robot's gripper is on the right side of the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the peg")

Finally, we can move the peg to the goal location.
if check("the robot's gripper is above peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the target location")


Steps:
1. Put gripper directly above the peg 
2. Drop gripper around the peg 
3. Close gripper around peg 
4. Move peg out of the hole 
5. Move peg to target location 

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper directly above the peg
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("directly above the peg")
    #  2. Drop gripper around the peg
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg", close_gripper=True)
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the peg", close_gripper=True)
    #  4. Move peg out of the hole
    # To move the peg out of the hole, the robot can move the peg sideways.
    # Because the peg is in a hole, look at it from the front.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg")
    # Move the peg out of the hole by moving the gripper to the left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the peg")
    #  5. Move peg to target location
    if check("the peg is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above target location")
