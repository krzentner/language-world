Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Put the stick against the thermos  4. Pull the thermos with the stick
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
   If the stick is not near the thermos, move the stick towards the thermos by moving the robot's gripper.
   - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos
   If the stick is near the thermos, we can put the stick against the thermos.
   - When the stick is near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is against the thermos
   Now that the stick is against the thermos, just pull the thermos with the stick.
   - When the stick is against the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
