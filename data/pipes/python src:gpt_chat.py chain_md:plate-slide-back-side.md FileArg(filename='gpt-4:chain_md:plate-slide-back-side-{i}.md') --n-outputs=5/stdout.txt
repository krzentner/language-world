Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the plate back sideways into the target location:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the target location  4. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Grab the plate with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around plate.
    Move the gripper above the target location with the plate in tow.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate and the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move the gripper above target location.
    Slide the plate back sideways into the target location, making sure the plate is centered in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the plate is not centered, the robot should slide the plate sideways into the target location.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper near the edge of the plate  2. Push the plate back into the target location sideways
First, put the gripper near the edge of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the plate, the robot should move gripper near the edge of the plate.
If the gripper is near the edge of the plate, we can slide the plate back into the target location sideways.
- When the robot's gripper is near the edge of the plate, the robot should push the plate back into the target location sideways.
The following steps can help the robot slide the plate back sideways into the target location:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Put gripper above the target location  4. Slide the plate back to the target location
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
If the gripper is not around the plate, move it around the plate and close the gripper to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the plate.
Once the gripper has got the plate, it should be moved to put the gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should put gripper above the target location.
Now that the robot's gripper is above the target location, slide the plate back towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the plate is not at the target location, the robot should slide the plate back towards the target location.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate becomes too far from the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. 
    - When the plate is not below the robot's gripper and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should grab plate.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location, the robot should align plate to target location.
    If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, slide it towards the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate sideways towards the target location.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the plate towards the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a flat object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the side instead of above it.
    - When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not sideways aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the plate.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't at the target location yet, move the plate towards the target location.
    - When the plate is not within the target location area, the robot should move the plate towards the target location.
    If the plate is lined up with the target location from the side, slide it in.
    - When the plate is sideways aligned with the target location rectangle, the robot should slide the plate back into the target location.
