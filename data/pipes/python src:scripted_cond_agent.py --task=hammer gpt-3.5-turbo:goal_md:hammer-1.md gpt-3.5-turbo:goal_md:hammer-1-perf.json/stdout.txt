To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hammer handle  2. Drop gripper around the hammer handle  3. Line up the hammer with the nail  4. Apply downward force to hit the nail with the hammer
    First, put the gripper above the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer handle
    Next, grab the hammer by dropping the gripper around the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is holding the hammer, line up the hammer with the nail.
    - When the hammer is not lined up with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is lined up with the nail
    As long as the hammer is above the nail, apply downward force to hit the nail with the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail, apply downward force to hit the nail with the hammer.
