    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Line up the gripper at the back of the plate  3. Slide the plate back into the goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate a bit and line up the gripper to the back of the plate. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can start sliding the plate back. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    When the gripper is looking back at the plate, slide the plate back into the goal. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the plate is not back of robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the plate is back of robot's gripper
