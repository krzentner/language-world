Solution:

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the edge of the dial"):
        robot.drop("gripper around dial edge")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the edge of the dial"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise/counterclockwise")
```


Solution:

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial"):
        robot.grab("gripper around dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around dial"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise")
```


The following code:

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper near dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial"):
        robot.grab("dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the dial is in the right notched position"):
        robot.turn("dial right")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the dial is in the left notched position"):
        robot.turn("dial left")
```


If check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
    robot.put("gripper above dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial"):
    robot.drop("gripper around dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the dial"):
    robot.turn("dial in desired direction")


The program should check that the robot's gripper is not above the dial, then move the gripper near the dial, and turn the dial clockwise.

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.move("gripper near dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the dial"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise")
```
