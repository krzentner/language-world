To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put the gripper near the wrench and the peg  2. Open the gripper around the wrench  3. Insert the peg into the wrench  4. Close the gripper around the peg and the wrench
    First, the robot should position its gripper near both the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the peg, the robot should put gripper near the wrench and the peg.
    Once the gripper is close enough to the wrench, open the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is not open, the robot should open the gripper around the wrench.
    Once the wrench is open, position the peg into the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should insert the peg into the wrench.
    Finally, close the gripper to hold the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper has both the wrench and the peg, the robot should close the gripper around them both.
