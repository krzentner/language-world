    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Push the plate to the goal  3. Slide the plate to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    We can push the plate to the goal by pushing down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should push the plate to the goal.
    If the gripper is near the plate and the plate is still not at the goal, we need to slide the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not at the goal, the robot should slide plate to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the edge of the plate  2. Grab the plate by the edge  3. Slide the plate to the target location
    Make sure that the gripper is near the edge of the plate before grabbing it, so we have a good grip. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the plate, the robot should put gripper near edge of plate.
    Now that the grip is lined up with the edge of the plate, close the gripper tight and slide the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the edge of plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab plate by edge.
    If the plate is located in front of the gripper as seen from above, we can keep sliding the plate to the target location by slowly moving the gripper. If the plate is too far away, move the gripper back towards the plate before pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the edge of the plate and the plate is forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should slide plate to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push down on the plate  3. Slide the plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Now that the gripper is above the plate, push down to trap the plate, then move the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate, the robot should push down on the plate.
    If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it. Use the gripper to slowly move the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Push plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the plate, we should be able to grab the plate by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate, the robot should put gripper around plate. 
    Once the gripper is around the plate, we can just push the plate to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate, the robot should push plate to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push plate with gripper  3. Slide into position
    Put the gripper above the plate because it's a flat object and won't work with a side alignment.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, apply downward pressure to push the plate so that its edge is lined up with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate, the robot should push plate with gripper.
    Now that the plate's edge is lined up with the target location, move the gripper right or left to slide the plate into position.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is aligned with target location, the robot should slide plate into position.
