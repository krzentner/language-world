Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
This function has already been defined earlier. Please see the "drawer-open" function above.
It looks like the function for drawer-open was already defined earlier. Did you mean to define it again or make changes to it?
Sorry, there seems to be a duplicate function of `drawer_open`. Here are the functions for `close_drawer` and `open_drawer` instead:

# close-drawer: push the drawer close
# def close_drawer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")

# open-drawer: pull the drawer open
# def open_drawer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")
Sorry, it looks like we already defined the `drawer_open()` function earlier in this code snippet. Maybe you meant to define a different function instead?
I already provided the code for "drawer-open" function. Do you need help with anything else?
