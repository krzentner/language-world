    # trying to grab it.

    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.

        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
