    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Put gripper against the plate  3. Push the plate sideways
    Put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the gripper is above the plate, the robot needs to push the plate to move it. We need to put the gripper up against the plate to do that. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not against the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is against the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is against the plate, slide it sideways until it's in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is against the plate and the plate is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location
