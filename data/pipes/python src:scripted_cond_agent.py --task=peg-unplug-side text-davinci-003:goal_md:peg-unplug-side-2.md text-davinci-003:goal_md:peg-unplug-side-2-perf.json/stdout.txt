    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab peg with gripper  3. Pull peg out 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is forward aligned with the peg and closed, pull the peg out from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the peg is being pulled out from the side
