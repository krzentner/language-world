Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the door handle before grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, detect the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, the robot should pull away from door.
