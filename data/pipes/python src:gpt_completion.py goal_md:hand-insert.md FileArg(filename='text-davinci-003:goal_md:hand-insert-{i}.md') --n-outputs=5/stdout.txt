    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck 2. Trap the puck with the gripper 3. Move the puck to the target location
    Firstly, put the gripper roughly above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the robot's gripper is above the puck, trap it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, hold on to it while moving to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper is not around the puck, put the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is near the puck, we can grab the puck by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Grip around puck  4. Lift puck  5. Move puck to target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck before we can pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, drop the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can pick it up by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move robot's gripper upwards to lift the puck
    If the puck is lifted, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the puck  2. Close grip around the puck  3. Move to the target location  4. Release the grip
    First, put the gripper around the puck. Make sure the robot's gripper is closed so the objects don't reject the robot's grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is above the puck and closed, we've probably trapped the puck and can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Once the gripper is near the target, release the grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open
