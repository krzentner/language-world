For the `button-press` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of button  2. Close the gripper around button  3. Push the button
    First, put the gripper in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is closed around the button, just push it to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing against the button
