    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Drop gripper around the wrench  3. Position the wrench around the peg  4. Close the wrench around the peg
    First, we put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put the gripper above the wrench.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can move the gripper around it and line it up with the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the wrench.
    After the gripper is around the wrench and the peg is aligned, close the wrench around the peg to hold the peg in place.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the peg is aligned, the robot should close the wrench around the peg.

    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the wrench up with the peg  4. Slide the wrench around the peg 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    Once the gripper is near the peg, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    Align the wrench with the peg to slide the wrench around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with peg, the robot should align wrench with peg.
    Slide the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the wrench is horizontally aligned with peg, the robot should slide wrench around peg.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line up the wrench with the peg  4. Drop the wrench onto the peg  5. Twist the wrench until it’s around the peg 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the wrench is still too high and the peg isn't aligned with the wrench yet, line up the wrench and the peg.
    - When the wrench is too high and the peg is not forward aligned with the wrench, the robot should line up wrench and peg.
    As long as the wrench and peg are lined up, close the gripper to drop the wrench onto the peg.
    - When the wrench is forward aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop wrench onto peg.
    Once the wrench is on the peg, twist the wrench until it’s around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should twist wrench until it's around peg.


Steps: 1. Put gripper above peg  2. Drop gripper around peg  3. Line up wrench with peg  4. Close wrench around peg 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, the robot should drop the grip around peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should line up the wrench with the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's wrench is aligned with the peg, the robot should close the wrench around the peg.

    Steps:  1. Put the wrench in front of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the wrench  3. Move the wrench and peg together to form the desired assembly
    First, put the wrench in front of the peg.
    - When the wrench is not in front of the peg, the robot should put wrench in front of peg.
    Once the wrench is lined up in front of the peg, try to grab the peg with the wrench.
    - When the peg is not in the wrench and the wrench is in front of the peg, the robot should grab peg.
    Lastly, once the peg is in the wrench, form the desired assembly by moving the wrench and peg together.
    - When the peg is in the wrench, the robot should move wrench and peg together to form the desired assembly.
