    Steps:  1. Grab the cube from the top  2. Place cube in the location  3. Move sideways the cube to the target location
    First, the robot must grab the cube from the top. This would involve putting the gripper over the cube, and then dropping the gripper around the cube. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, the robot can then lift it up and start moving it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and cube is not in the location, the robot should place cube in location.
    The robot should then move slightly sideways until the cube is in the desired position.
    - When the cube is in the location and the cube is not at the target location, the robot should move sideways the cube to the target location.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to the goal
    We need to put the gripper above the cube first, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    As long as the gripper is above the cube, closing it should trap the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can just move it sideways to the goal area.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should move cube sideways to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to goal 
    First, put the gripper above the cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
    Next, if the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    Now that the gripper is in place, close the gripper to trap the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Finally, move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should move the cube sideways to the goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab cube with gripper  3. Move cube sideways to target
    First, we need to put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is roughly lined up above the cube, move the gripper down around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, the robot should grab cube with gripper.
    Now that the cube is tightly in the grip of the robot, we can just move it sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the cube is not beside target location, the robot should move cube sideways to target.

    Steps:  1. Move gripper above cube  2. Put gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways  5. Place cube at goal
    First, move the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should move gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, place it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not closed, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Now that the gripper is closed, we can move the cube sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube sideways.
    Lastly, place the cube at the goal.
    - When the cube is sideways to the robot, the robot should place cube at goal.
