Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
To reliably push down the handle from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around handle and the handle is not on the side of the gripper, the robot should move the handle to the side.
- When the handle is on the side of the gripper and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on the handle.
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the handle is not left of the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the handle and the handle is not almost vertical, the robot should rotate the handle downwards.
- When the handle is almost vertical, the robot should push down on the handle.
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When handle is not left of the robot's gripper and handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not horizontally aligned with target, the robot should align handle to target.
- When handle is horizontally aligned with target, the robot should push down on the handle.
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle, the robot should push sideways on the handle to push it down.
To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper beside the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is beside the handle, the robot should push the handle downward.
