    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the plate  2. Slide the plate back and sideways  3. Move the plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper left of the plate before sliding it back.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is left of the gripper, start sliding the plate back.
    - When the plate is left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is slightly in front and right of the plate
    Now that we've started sliding the plate, keep sliding it back by moving the gripper away from the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location


Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push the plate sideways until it meets the wall  3. Slide the plate back until it reaches the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
Once the gripper is above the plate we can start pushing the plate to the side.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is adjacent to the wall
Once the plate is next to the wall, it limits its movement in one direction. We can now slide the plate back to the target location.
- When the plate is adjacent to the wall and the plate is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is near the target location.

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper at one side of the plate  2. Push sideways to the begin the slide  3. Push further towards the target location
    First, put the gripper at one side of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at one side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at one side of the plate
    If the robot's gripper is lined up with the plate, we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is at one side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate 
    If the robot's gripper is aligned with the plate, we can start pushing the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper across the plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Slide the plate back until it is in the target location
    First, put the gripper across the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate but not across it, we can push the plate back by pushing against its side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not across plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is across the plate
    Now that the plate is aligned, we can slide the plate back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is across plate and the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Line up the gripper at the back of the plate  3. Slide the plate back into the goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate a bit and line up the gripper to the back of the plate. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can start sliding the plate back. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    When the gripper is looking back at the plate, slide the plate back into the goal. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the plate is not back of robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the plate is back of robot's gripper
