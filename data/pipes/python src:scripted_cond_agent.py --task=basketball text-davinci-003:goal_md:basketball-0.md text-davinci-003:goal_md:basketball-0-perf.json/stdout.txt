    Steps:  1. Find a suitable throwing angle from the robot's position  2. Raise the gripper to the throwing angle  3. Release the ball from the gripper  4. Push the ball towards the hoop
    We can start by finding a suitable angle from the robot's position before starting to throw the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at a suitable throwing angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at a suitable throwing angle
    When the robot's gripper is at a suitable throwing angle, we can now raise the gripper to the throwing angle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the throwing angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the throwing angle
    Once the gripper is in position, we can release the ball from the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the throwing angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and the robot's gripper is away from the ball
    Finally, to push the ball towards the hoop, carefully release the ball and move the robot's gripper away from the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is away from the ball and finger will not touch the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from the ball and the ball is in front of the hoop
