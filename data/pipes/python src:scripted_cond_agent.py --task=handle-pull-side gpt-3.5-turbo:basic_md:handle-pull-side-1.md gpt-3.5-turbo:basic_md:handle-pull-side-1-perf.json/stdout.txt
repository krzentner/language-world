To reliably pull up the handle from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should move the gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the gripper is not gripping the handle, the robot should grip the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the handle and the handle is not in the upright position, the robot should pull the handle up to the upright position.
