To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the wall.
- When the puck is against the wall, the robot should move to the other side of the wall.
- When the robot is at the other side of the wall, the robot should move to the location on the other side of the puck.
- When the robot is at the location on the other side of the puck, the robot should proceed to slide the puck towards the target location without hitting the wall. 
- When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should release the puck.
