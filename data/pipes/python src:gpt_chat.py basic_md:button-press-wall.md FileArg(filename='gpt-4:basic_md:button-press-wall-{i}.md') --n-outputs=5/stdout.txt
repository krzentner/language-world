To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is below the wall height, the robot should raise its gripper to the height above the wall and horizontal to the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, the robot should move forward until it is appropriately aligned.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button with its gripper.
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not at the right distance from the button, the robot should move gripper closer to the button while keeping it in front of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is at the right distance from the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper up.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on button. If the wall is too high, the robot may need to adjust the angle of the gripper to avoid hitting the wall.
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper in front of the button, but not too close to the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button, the robot should tilt gripper towards the button while moving closer.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should push the button while keeping the gripper tilted towards the button. If the gripper is too wide, the robot should move back slightly to avoid hitting the wall.
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and there is a wall in front of the robot, the robot should move closer to the wall until the gripper can reach the button without hitting the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the button and there is a wall in front of the robot, the robot should push the button with enough force to overcome the resistance of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the button and there is no wall in front of the robot, the robot should push the button with a gentle force.
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not obstructed by the wall, the robot should move towards the button.
- When the robot's gripper is obstructed by the wall, the robot should move to the side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not gripping anything, the robot should drop the gripper onto the button.
- When the robot's gripper is pressing down on the button, the robot should release the button and move away from the button to complete the task.
