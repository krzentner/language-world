    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Turn dial with gripper  3. Push dial to goal
    First, the robot should put the gripper roughly above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    If the gripper is above the dial, rotate the gripper to turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial, the robot should turn dial with gripper.
    We've turned the dial, so push the dial to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial, the robot should push dial to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Grip the dial with gripper  3. Turn dial to goal direction 
    First, put the gripper above the dial to be sure of where it's going to grab.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    Once the gripper is above the dial, it's time to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, the robot should grab dial with gripper. 
    Now that the dial is in the grip, it's time to turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, the robot should turn dial to goal direction.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Grab dial with gripper  3. Start turning dial
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    If the gripper is around the dial, start turning it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    If the gripper is around the dial, we can start turning it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, the robot should turn dial.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Line up the gripper with the dial  3. Start turning the dial to the desired position  4. Check to make sure dial is moving
    To turn the dial, we need to first put the gripper near the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should put gripper near dial.
    Then, we need to align the gripper with the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with dial, the robot should align gripper with dial.
    Now, start turning the dial to the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with dial, the robot should start turning dial.
    Keep turning it and checking to make sure it is still turning.
    - When the robot's gripper is still horizontally aligned with dial, the robot should check to make sure dial is still moving.


Steps:  1. Pick up the dial eventually with the robot's gripper  2. Move the dial in the intended direction  3. Stop turning when dial is facing the desired position
    When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, we should move the gripper to the dial to eventually pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper to dial.
    If the dial is near the gripper, we can start turning it in the intended direction.
 - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the dial is not facing the desired position, the robot should turn the dial in the intended direction.
    When the dial is facing the desired position, the robot can stop turning.
- When the dial is facing the desired position, the robot should stop turning the dial.
