    Steps:  1. Put gripper above faucet handle  2. Grab faucet handle  3. Turn the faucet handle right 
    The robot needs to put gripper above the faucet handle first before it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around faucet handle.
    If the gripper is closed, turn it to the right to turn the faucet off.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around faucet handle, the robot should turn the faucet handle right.
