Steps:  1. Put gripper behind the plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Slide the plate
    If the robot's gripper is not behind the plate, we should move the gripper near the back side of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind the plate and the robot's gripper is below the plate, the robot should move gripper behind plate.
    If the robot's gripper is at the back side of the plate, we should be able to slide the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the plate, the robot should push plate back.
    If the plate has moved back a bit, the robot can slide it into place.
    - When the plate is pushed back, the robot should slide plate.
