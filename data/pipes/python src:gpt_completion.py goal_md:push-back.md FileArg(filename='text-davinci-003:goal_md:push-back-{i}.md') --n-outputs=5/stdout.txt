    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into rear of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing up on it from behind and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't behind the gripper as seen from behind, move the gripper behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper up to the puck to slide it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper towards goal  3. Slide puck backwards to goal
    To push the puck back, put the gripper behind the puck by starting near it and moving back.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Then, if the gripper is behind the puck and the gripper is closed, push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck and the puck is not near the goal, move the robot's gripper until the puck is near the goal

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push the puck with one finger of the robot's gripper  3. Slide puck to goal
    We want to be able to gently sliding the puck back, so we'll just start by putting the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    Now that the gripper is above the puck, we can just slide the puck back by pushing on it with one finger of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

Steps:  1. Put gripper behind the puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck towards goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing from behind and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't behind the gripper as seen from behind, move the gripper behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper to the back of the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not behind puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is behind the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the puck is forward of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper below puck  2. Push gripper into the bottom of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck backwards by trapping it by pushing up on it from below and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't above the gripper as seen from below, move the gripper below the puck. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not below puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper up to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the target location
