The steps for reliably pushing the soccer ball into the target location are as follows:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near to ball  2. Push ball into the target location
    First, the robot needs to move the gripper near to the soccer ball. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near to the ball, the robot should move the gripper near to the ball.
    If the gripper is aligned with the ball but not near it, move the gripper to the ball to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is nearby the ball, the robot should push the ball into the target location.
