To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should drop gripper around puck, taking into consideration the presence of the short wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck, again taking into consideration the presence of the short wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck while moving the gripper upward and also moving it away from the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the gripper with the puck while also moving it to the side to avoid colliding with the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is over the target location and above the wall, the robot should release the puck by opening its gripper.
