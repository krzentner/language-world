To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put the gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not to the left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not already holding the handle, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is positioned to the side of the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle.
To reliably pull up the handle from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should move the gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the gripper is not gripping the handle, the robot should grip the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the handle and the handle is not in the upright position, the robot should pull the handle up to the upright position.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is facing to the side, the robot should pull the handle up while moving the gripper to the side.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should position gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not vertically aligned, the robot should lift the handle up from the side.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, put gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move gripper to the side of the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, pull up on the handle.
