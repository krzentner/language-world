Steps:
1. Put gripper left of the door handle
2. Push the door closed

    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door handle")


Steps:
1. Put gripper near the door handle
2. Push the door closed

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the door handle
    #  2. Push the door closed
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left or right of the door handle")


Then continue from there:

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the door handle
    #  2. Line the gripper up with the door handle
    #  3. Push the door closed to the target location
    # If the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door handle")

    # Once the gripper is near the door handle, align it with the door handle so that it can close the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the door handle")

    # When the gripper is in the right spot, just push the door closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the door handle")

```


Here's the program:

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of the door handle
    #  2. Push against the door handle to move the door
    #  3. Push the door closed more
    # First, we need to move the robot's gripper near the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the door handle, we just need to push the
    # door closed a little to start the door moving.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the door handle")
    # Once the door is moving, push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the door handle")
    # Keep pushing until the door closes.
    if check("the door is not closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the door handle")
```


Then proceed with the code:

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the door handle
    #  2. Push the door closed
    # If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door handle")
    # If the gripper is near the door handle, push the door closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the door handle")
    # If the door is near the target location, slow down the robot's movements
    # so it does not crash into the wall.
    if check("the door is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("slowly towards the target location")
```
