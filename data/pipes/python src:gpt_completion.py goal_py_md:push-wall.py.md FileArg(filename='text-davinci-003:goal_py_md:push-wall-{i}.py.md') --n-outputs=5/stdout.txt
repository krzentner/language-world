Steps:
  1. Put gripper above puck
  2. Push gripper into top of puck
  3. Slide puck to goal
  4. Move the wall out of the way

First, put the gripper above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.

If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, we can move it to the puck to begin pushing it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper is above the puck, but the gripper isn't near the puck, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. However, we need to first move the wall out of the way.

We can pick the wall up with the gripper, move it to the side of the target location, and then return to the puck.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
    # Pick up the wall
    robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    robot.move_gripper("above the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # Move the wall to the side of the target location
    robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")
    robot.move_gripper("above the target location", open_gripper=True)
    # Return to the puck
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Push the puck to the target location
    robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```

Finally, once the puck is near the target, we can open the gripper to let go of the puck.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the target location", open_gripper=True)

```


Steps:
1. Put gripper near the wall
2. Push against the wall
3. Move the puck to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move it to the wall. We don't need to be too precise, since we're just using the wall for support. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
```

Once the gripper is close to the wall, push against the wall by moving the gripper to the left. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("left of the wall")
```

Now that the puck can move, slide it to the target location by moving the gripper to the target location while keeping the gripper pressed against the wall. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is left of the wall and the puck is not near the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


The robot needs to be able to slide the puck to the target location while a wall is in the way. 

Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Slide puck to goal

First, the robot needs to put the gripper roughly above the puck, so it doesn't bump it while attempting to grab it. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
``` 

If the gripper isn't around the puck, it needs to be moved around the puck. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is near the puck and it is closed, the robot needs to move its gripper to the side of the wall. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the side of the wall")
```

Once the gripper is near the wall, the robot can move it to the other side of the wall to slide the puck to the target. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the side of the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("on the other side of the wall")
```

Finally, the robot can move its gripper to the target location to complete the task. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


The robot needs to push the puck around a small wall to get to the target location.

Steps:

1. Put gripper in front of puck, keeping the small wall in between
2. Put the gripper around the wall, resting on the wall
3. Push the wall forward and move the puck to the target location 

if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of the puck, with the wall in between"):
    robot.move_gripper("in front of the puck, with the wall in between")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the wall, resting on it"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the wall, resting on it")
if check("the wall is not in between the puck and the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("in between the puck and the target location")


In order to push the puck to the goal location, the robot must first line up its gripper around the puck with a small wall in the way. To do this, we must first move the gripper to an area above the wall and the puck. Then, we move the gripper down to the puck, trapping it in-between the gripper and the wall. Once the gripper is tight against the wall and the puck, we can slide the puck to the goal location.

# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wall and puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck while pressing against wall
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the small wall and the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above wall and puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above wall and puck")
    # Then, drop the gripper around the puck while pressing against the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is around the puck and tethered to the wall, we can
    # slide the puck to the goal location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
