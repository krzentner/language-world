    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Re-align the gripper with the wall in the way  3. Push down on the button from the top
    When we have a wall in the way, we need to line up the gripper with the wall first. Put the gripper so that it's at an angle above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not angled above button, the robot should put gripper angled above button.
    Then re-line up the gripper so that it's parallel to the wall in the way.
    - When robot's gripper is not parallel with wall, the robot should align gripper to wall.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, we can push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is parallel to the wall and is above button, the robot should push down on button.
