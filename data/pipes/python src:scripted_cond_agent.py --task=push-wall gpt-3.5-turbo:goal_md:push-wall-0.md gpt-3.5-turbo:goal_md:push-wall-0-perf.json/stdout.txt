To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Move the gripper towards the target location, checking for obstacles along the way.
    - If the gripper encounters an obstacle, adjust the gripper's position and orientation accordingly until it can continue moving towards the target location.
4. If the gripper is near the wall, move the gripper to the side of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall, move the robot's gripper to the left or right depending on which direction leads to the target location and adjust the orientation accordingly.
5. Slide the puck towards the target location, carefully avoiding hitting the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
    - Slowly slide the puck towards the target location, keeping a close eye on the position of the wall to ensure the puck doesn't hit it.
6. Release the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location with the puck, release the gripper to drop the puck at the target location.
