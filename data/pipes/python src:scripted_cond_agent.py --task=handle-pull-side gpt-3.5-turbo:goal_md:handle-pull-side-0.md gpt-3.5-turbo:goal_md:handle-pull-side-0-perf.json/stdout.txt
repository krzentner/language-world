To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Lift the handle upwards
    First, put the gripper around the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, lift the handle upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper upwards until the handle is lifted to the desired height.
