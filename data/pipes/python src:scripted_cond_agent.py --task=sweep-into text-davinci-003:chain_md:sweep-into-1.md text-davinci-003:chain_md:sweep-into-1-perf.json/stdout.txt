    Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Place gripper around the cube  3. Lift and carry the cube to goal 
    First, move the robot's gripper towards the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, the robot should reach towards cube.
    If the cube is near the gripper, trap it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is closed, lift the cube and move it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the cube is lifted in the gripper, the robot should move cube to goal.
