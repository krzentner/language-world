To pull the peg out from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Move the peg to the side  4. Pull the peg out
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, move the peg to the side to loosen it from its socket.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not moved to the side, move the robot's gripper until the peg is moved to the side
    Finally, pull the peg out of the socket.
    - When the peg is moved to the side, move the robot's gripper until the peg is pulled out of the socket.
