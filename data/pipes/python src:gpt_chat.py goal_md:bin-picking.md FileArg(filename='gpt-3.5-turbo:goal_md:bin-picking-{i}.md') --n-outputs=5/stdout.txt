Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Here are the steps the robot should follow for the `bin-picking` task:

1. Put the gripper above the cube
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
2. Open the gripper and drop it around the cube
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open
3. Close the gripper and lift the cube
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, close the robot's gripper around the cube and lift the cube
4. Move the gripper above the target bin and release the cube
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, release the cube into the target bin
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Locate the cube and determine its position and orientation
2. Position the gripper above the cube
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
3. Lower the gripper onto the cube and close the gripper
   - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
4. Lift the cube and move it towards the target bin
   - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, lift the cube by moving the robot's gripper up
   - When the cube is positioned above the target bin, move the gripper towards the bin
5. Release the cube into the target bin
   - When the robot's gripper is above the bin, open the gripper to release the cube into the bin.
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Lift the cube and move it towards the bin  4. Release the cube into the bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the gripper is above the cube, grab the cube tightly.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Move the gripper up to lift the cube and then move it towards the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the bin
    Once the gripper is above the bin, release the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the bin and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and no longer around the cube.
The task `bin-picking` can be performed using the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above cube  2. Open gripper  3. Move gripper down to cube  4. Close gripper around cube  5. Lift cube  6. Move gripper to target bin  7. Lower gripper into target bin  8. Open gripper to release cube

First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
If the gripper is not around the cube, move the gripper down to the cube, open the gripper, and grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open
Once the gripper has the cube, lift it up.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the bin
Move the gripper to the target bin and lower the gripper into it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the correct height and the robot's gripper is closed
Open the gripper to release the cube into the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is at the correct height and the robot's gripper is above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Locate the cube
    - When the cube is not in vision, move the robot's gripper until the cube is in vision
2. Put gripper above the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
3. Drop gripper around the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
4. Close gripper around cube
5. Lift gripper with cube
6. Move gripper to the target bin
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
7. Drop the cube into the target bin 
    - Open the gripper to release the cube into the bin
8. Move gripper away from bin 

It's important to note that the exact positioning and movement of the gripper depends on the specific design of the robot and the objects being manipulated. These steps provide a general guideline for reliable object manipulation in a bin-picking scenario.
