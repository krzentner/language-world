Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever  2. Grab the lever with the gripper  3. Pull up on the lever
 - When the robot's gripper is not above the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
 - When the robot's gripper is not around lever and robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
 - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the lever is below the robot's gripper
 - When the lever is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the lever is pulled up
