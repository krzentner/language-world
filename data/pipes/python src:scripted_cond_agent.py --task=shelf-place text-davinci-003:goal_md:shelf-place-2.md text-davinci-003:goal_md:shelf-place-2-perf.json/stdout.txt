Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Lower the gripper to scoop up the block  3. Move the block to the target location  4. Release the block
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
- When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is open
