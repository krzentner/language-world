The robot should perform the following steps to pull the drawer open reliably:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.
    - If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.
    - Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the gripper down around the drawer handle.
    - If the gripper is not around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is around the drawer handle.
    - Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, pull the drawer open.
    - If the gripper is not horizontally aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle.
The steps the robot should perform to pull the drawer open reliably are:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle: The robot needs to put the gripper above the drawer handle before it can grab and pull it. The robot should move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle: Once the gripper is above the drawer handle, the robot should move the gripper down until it is around the handle.
3. Pull open the drawer: Once the gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull the drawer open. If the drawer is difficult to open, the robot may need to apply more force by increasing the grip strength on the handle or pulling with more force. 

Once the robot has successfully opened the drawer, it may need to move its gripper back to its original location if this is required for the task.
The robot should perform the following steps to reliably pull open a drawer:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.

To put the gripper above the drawer handle, the robot should move its gripper until it is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.

Next, the robot should drop its gripper around the drawer handle. The robot should move its gripper until it is around the drawer handle to have a good grip on it.

Finally, the robot should pull the drawer open by moving its gripper in the direction away from the drawer handle.
The robot should perform the following steps to pull the drawer open reliably:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.
    - Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform these steps:

1. Put gripper above drawer handle
2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
3. Pull open the drawer

- First, put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
- Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
- Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
- When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle.
