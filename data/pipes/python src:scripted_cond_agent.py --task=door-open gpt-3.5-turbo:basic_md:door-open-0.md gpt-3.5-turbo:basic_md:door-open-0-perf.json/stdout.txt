To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull door open.
