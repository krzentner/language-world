Steps:
1. Put gripper above the stick
2. Grab the stick with the gripper
3. Move the stick to the thermos
4. Put the end of the stick in the notch of the thermos
5. Pull the thermos to the target location

If check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
    robot.put("gripper above stick")

If check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick"):
    robot.grab("stick")

If check("the robot's gripper is around stick and the end of the stick is not near the notch on the thermos"):
    robot.move("stick to near the notch of the thermos")

If check("the end of the stick is near the notch of the thermos and the end of the stick is not in the notch"):
    robot.place("end of the stick in the notch of the thermos")

If check("the end of the stick is in the notch of the thermos"):
    robot.pull("the thermos to the target location")


The steps would be:
1. Put the gripper above the stick
2. Grab the stick with the gripper
3. Line the stick up with the thermos
4. Push the thermos toward the target location using the stick

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, we should move the gripper near the stick to start grabbing it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.move("gripper to above the stick")
```

Once the robot's gripper is above the stick, we can grab it by closing the gripper around it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("stick")
```

Once the robot's gripper has a hold on the stick, we can try to line up the stick with the thermos using the gripper. 

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not horizontally aligned with thermos"):
        robot.align("stick to thermos")
```

Once the stick is lined up with the thermos, we can push the thermos with the stick toward the target location.

```
    if check("the stick is horizontally aligned with thermos"):
        robot.push("thermos toward goal")
```


To complete the task:
    1. Put the gripper above the stick
    2. Put the gripper around the stick
    3. Pull the stick away from the thermos
    4. Move the stick to the target location
    5. Put the gripper above the thermos
    6. Move the gripper to the target location

Steps:
1. Put the gripper between the stick and the thermos.
2. Push the gripper against the stick.
3. Pull the gripper with the stick.
4. Move the stick and thermos to the target location.
