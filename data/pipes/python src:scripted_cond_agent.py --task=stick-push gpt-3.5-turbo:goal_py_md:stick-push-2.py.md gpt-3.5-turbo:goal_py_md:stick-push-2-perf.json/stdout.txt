# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Drop gripper around stick

    #  5. Position stick as close to the thermos as possible

    # First, put the gripper roughly above the stick, so that we don't bump
    # it while trying to grab it.

    # closing the gripper.
