The task `sweep` requires the robot to grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location. To achieve this, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Place the gripper above the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.

2. Close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.

3. Lift the cube and move it towards the target location.
- When the gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should lift it off the ground.
- Move the cube sideways to reach the target location.

4. Release the cube.
- When the cube reaches the target location, the robot should release the gripper to place the cube. 

By following these steps, the robot can reliably grab the cube and move it to the target location.
To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the cube 
2. Grab the cube with the gripper 
3. Move the cube towards the target location 
4. Move the cube sideways to the target location 
5. Release the cube 

First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
Once the gripper is above the cube, grab the cube with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
Try to move the cube towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, the robot should move the cube towards the target location.
If the cube is near the target location, move it sideways to the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should move the cube sideways to the goal.
Release the cube at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is at the goal location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
To sweep the cube to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube. 2. Grab the cube. 3. Move the cube to the target location sideways. 
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can move it to the target location by moving it sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should move the cube sideways to the target location.
To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the cube 2. Grab the cube with the gripper 3. Lift the cube slightly off the ground 4. Move sideways to the target location while holding the cube 5. Lower the cube at the target location

First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube. 
As long as the gripper is still mostly around the cube and the cube isn't lifted off the ground, grab the cube with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not lifted from the ground, the robot should grab the cube. 
Lift the cube slightly off the ground so that it can move smoothly.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should lift the cube slightly off the ground. 
While holding the cube, move the robot sideways towards the target location.
- When the robot is holding the cube, the robot should move sideways towards the target location. 
At the target location, lower the cube to the ground.
- When the robot reaches the target location with the cube, the robot should lower the cube at the target location.
The steps the robot should perform to grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location are:

1. Put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
2. Grab the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should grab the cube.
3. Move the gripper sideways towards the target location while holding the cube.
    - If the target location is to the right of the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the right while holding the cube.
    - If the target location is to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left while holding the cube.
4. Release the cube at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should release the cube.
