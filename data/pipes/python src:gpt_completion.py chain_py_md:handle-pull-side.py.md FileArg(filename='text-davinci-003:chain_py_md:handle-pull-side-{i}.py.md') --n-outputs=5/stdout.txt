Using model: text-davinci-003


The code for the task should be:

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper right of the handle
    #  2. Grab the handle with the gripper
    #  3. Pull up the handle
    # First, put the gripper right of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper right of handle")
    # As long as the gripper isn't around the handle, move the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    # If the gripper is around the handle, we can probably grab it by closing the 
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle")
    # If the gripper is grabbing the handle, try to pull the handle up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above handle
  2. Move gripper around to the side
  3. Pull handle up

# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Move gripper around to the side
    #  3. Pull handle up
    # First move the gripper above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Move the gripper around to the side of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not to the side of the handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to side of handle")
    # Once the gripper is to the side of the handle, pull it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the side of the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")


The program should look like this:

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper on the side of the handle
    #  2. Pull up the handle
    # First, put the gripper to the side of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper right of handle")
    # Now we can try to pull the handle up with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of the handle"):
        robot.pull("the handle up")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the handle 
2. Drop gripper around the handle 
3. Pull handle upwards 

# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around the handle
    #  3. Pull handle upwards
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle upwards")


The code for handle-pull-side would look like this:

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper just above handle
    #  2. Grab handle with gripper
    #  3. Pull handle with gripper
    # We need to be careful to line up the gripper with the handle, since the 
    # handle is small and the robot's gripper is round.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper just above handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, grab the handle by moving 
    # the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.grab("gripper around handle")
    # Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull the handle up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.pull("up on handle")
```
