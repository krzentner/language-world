    Steps:  1. Reach the target location with the gripper  2. Lift the gripper over the wall  3. Reach the target location
    We should start by reaching towards the target location with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target
    Once the gripper is near the target, we need to lift it up over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the reach target and the wall is in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Now that the gripper is above the wall, we can reach the target location again.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
