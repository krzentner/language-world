    Steps:  1. Put gripper about the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper and pull  3. Move the wrench with the gripper until it is off the peg
    First, put the gripper about the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near wrench and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    If the wrench is now horizontally aligned with the gripper, it should be ready to be grabbed.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab wrench.
    We grabbed the wrench with the gripper, now we can just pull the wrench away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move wrench until it is off the peg.
