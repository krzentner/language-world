    Steps:  1. Put the stick in the robot's gripper  2. Reach towards the thermos  3. Push the thermos with stick  4. Move the thermos to goal
    First, the robot needs to pick up the stick. This can be done by finding the stick, and getting the robot's gripper near the stick, and then closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should reach towards the stick.
    When the gripper is near the stick, grab it and hold it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
    Now that the robot has the stick, and is out of the way of the thermos, it's time to push the thermos. Reach towards the thermos and use the stick to push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos and the stick is in the robot's gripper, the robot should reach towards thermos.
    As long as the stick and the thermos are still lined up, keep pushing towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is in the robot's gripper, the robot should push thermos with stick.
    When the thermos is near the goal, slide it over to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the target location is in sight, the robot should slide thermos to goal.
