This program uses the `move` method to bring the gripper towards the wall, then the `find_gap` method is called to locate a gap in the wall where the gripper can pass through. Once a gap is found, the gripper is moved through the gap and towards the goal using the `move` method again. Finally, the `reach` method is called to reach the goal location.
