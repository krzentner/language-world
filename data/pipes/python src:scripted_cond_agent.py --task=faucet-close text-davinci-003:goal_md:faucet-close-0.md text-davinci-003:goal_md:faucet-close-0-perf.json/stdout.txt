    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the faucet  2. Push right on the faucet  3. Keep pushing right until the faucet is completely closed 
    First, put the gripper below the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beneath the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is beneath the faucet
    If the robot's gripper is below the faucet, we should be able to close it by pushing it right.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing right on the faucet
    If the faucet is not completely closed, keep pushing it until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing right on the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the faucet is completely closed
