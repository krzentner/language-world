To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until it's above the puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it's near the puck and then close the gripper
3. Move gripper towards the wall until it touches the wall
   - When the robot's gripper is not touching the wall, move the robot's gripper towards the wall until it touches the wall
4. Slide the puck to the right until it is clear of the wall
   - When the puck is not clear of the wall, move the robot's gripper to the right while pushing the puck until it clears the wall and is close to the target location
5. Move the gripper above the puck
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move it above the puck
6. Slide the puck to the target location
   - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the puck is clear of obstacles, move the gripper and the puck to the target location.
