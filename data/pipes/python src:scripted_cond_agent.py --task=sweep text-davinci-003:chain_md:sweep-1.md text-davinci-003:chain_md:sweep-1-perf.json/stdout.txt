    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to the goal
    We need to put the gripper above the cube first, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    As long as the gripper is above the cube, closing it should trap the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can just move it sideways to the goal area.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should move cube sideways to goal.
