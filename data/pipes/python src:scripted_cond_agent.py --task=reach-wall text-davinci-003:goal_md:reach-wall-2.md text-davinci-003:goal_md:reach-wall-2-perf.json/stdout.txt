    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the wall  2. Reach to target location
    First, move the robot's gripper so that it is on the wall and not in the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the wall and the wall is above the reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the wall
    Now that the gripper is on the wall, reach to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target
