Steps:
1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Move the peg sideways
4. Pull the peg out

# peg-unplug-side: pull the peg out from the side
# def peg_unplug_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Move the peg sideways
    #  4. Pull the peg out
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the peg, we should be able to
    # grab the peg by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # Now, we should be able to move the peg sideways
    if check("the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is not sideways to the hole"):
        robot.slide("peg sideways")
    # When the peg is sideways to the hole, we can pull it out.
    if check("the peg is sideways to the hole"):
        robot.pull("peg out")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the peg
  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
  3. Line the peg up with the hole
  4. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole

First, put the gripper above the peg.
if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
    robot.put("gripper above peg")

# If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
# above the peg.
# Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
# from the front instead of around it.
if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
    robot.grab("peg")

# As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined
# up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
    robot.align("peg to hole")

# If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, unplug it.
if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
    robot.pull("peg out of hole")


And finish with:

```
# If the robot's gripper is still around the peg and the peg is lined up with
# the hole to the side, pull it out.
if check("the robot's gripper is around peg and peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
    robot.pull("peg out from hole")
```


The steps for this task are:
1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line the peg up with the hole
4. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole

```

The rest of the program would look like this:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the gripper isn't around the peg, start to line up the gripper with
    # the peg by moving the gripper to the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg, line up the peg 
    # with the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole"):
        robot.align("peg to hole")
    # If the peg is lined up with the hole on the left side or right side, 
    # pull the peg out.
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.pull("away from hole")
```
