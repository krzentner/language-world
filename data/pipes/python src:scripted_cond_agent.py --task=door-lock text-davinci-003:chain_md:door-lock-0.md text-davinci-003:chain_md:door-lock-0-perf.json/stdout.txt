    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the right of the dial  2. Turn the dial clockwise  3.Confirm the door is unlocked 
    First, we need to line up the robot's gripper with the door handle. We want to line up the gripper so it's to the right of the dial. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not to the right of the door handle, the robot should put to the right of the door handle.
    Next, we need to turn the dial clockwise until it's in the "unlocked" position. 
    - When the robot's gripper is to the right of the door handle, the robot should turn the dial clockwise.
    Once the dial is in the "unlocked" position, open the door to confirm that the door is now unlocked. 
    - When the dial is in the unlocked position, the robot should open the door to confirm it is unlocked.
