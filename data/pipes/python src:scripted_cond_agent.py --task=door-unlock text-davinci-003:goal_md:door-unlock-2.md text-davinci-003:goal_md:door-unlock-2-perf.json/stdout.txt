    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Close the gripper around the door handle  3. Move the door handle counter-clockwise in small increments  4. Continue turning the handle until it unlocks
    First, put the gripper at the top of the door handle.
    -When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Then, close the gripper around the door handle.
    -When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can start turning it.
    -When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is not in its starting position, move the robot's gripper in small increments to turn the handle counter-clockwise
    Continue moving it until the door unlocks.
    -When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the door is not unlocked, move the robot's gripper in small increments to turn the handle counter-clockwise until the door unlocks
