To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the button on the open side of the wall 2. Line up the gripper with the button from the front  3. Push the button from the front

First, put the gripper near the button on the open side of the wall, where there is enough space to reach the button.
	- When the robot's gripper is not near the button on the open side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until it's near the button on the open side of the wall

Next, line up the gripper with the button from the front by moving it to a position where it can push the button.
	- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until it is aligned with the button from the front

Finally, push the button from the front until the button is fully pressed or the task is complete.
	- While pushing the button, check if the button is fully pressed. If not, continue pushing until it is fully pressed.
