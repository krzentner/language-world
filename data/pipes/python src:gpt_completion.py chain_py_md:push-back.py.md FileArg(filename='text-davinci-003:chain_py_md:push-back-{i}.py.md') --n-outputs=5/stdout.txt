Then write and adapt the code:

```
# push-back: slide the puck backwards to the target location
# def push_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into bottom of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing up on it from
    # below and moving the gripper.
    # If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from below, move the gripper
    # below the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper below the puck")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper
    # up to the puck to slide it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```


This task is similar to the `push` task, so the steps and code can be similar.

# push-back: slide the puck backwards to the target location
# def push_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into the front of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from
    # above and moving the gripper.
    # If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper
    # down to the puck to slide it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the front of puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck back to the goal")


Steps:
1. Put gripper behind puck
2. Push gripper into puck
3. Slide puck to goal

If the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, move the gripper behind it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not behind puck"):
    robot.put("gripper behind puck")
```

Once the gripper is behind the puck, push the gripper into it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
    robot.push("gripper into puck")
```

Finally, slide the puck to the goal.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper"):
    robot.slide("puck to goal")
```


Solution:
```
# push-back: slide the puck backwards to the target location
# def push_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into the top of puck
    #  3. Slide the puck to the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck to the goal by sliding it backwards, rather than
    # pulling it forwards.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal in the opposite direction")
```


The program should be as follows:

```
# push-back: slide the puck backwards to the target location
# def push_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper behind puck
    #  2. Push gripper into back of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from
    # behind and moving the gripper.
    # If the puck isn't behind the gripper as seen from behind, move the
    # gripper to behind the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper behind the puck")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper
    # back to the puck to slide it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```
