To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Pull the mug towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    If the gripper is not around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle.
    If the gripper is near the mug handle and open, grab the mug by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug handle.
    We closed the gripper, and the mug is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to pull the mug towards the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull mug towards the target location.
