    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the lever handle  2. Grab the lever handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the lever up
    First, the robot should move the gripper near the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever handle
    If the grip is close enough to the handle that the grip might be able to grab it, grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near lever handle and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the grip is closed around the handle, we can rotate the lever up.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is rotated up
