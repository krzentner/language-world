Here's the code to perform the `push` task:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
# def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```

This function first checks if the gripper is not above the puck and not vertically aligned with it. If so, the robot moves the gripper above the puck. Then, if the gripper is vertically aligned with the puck but not yet near it, the robot uses the gripper to push into the puck. Finally, when the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below it, the robot slides the puck to the goal location.
