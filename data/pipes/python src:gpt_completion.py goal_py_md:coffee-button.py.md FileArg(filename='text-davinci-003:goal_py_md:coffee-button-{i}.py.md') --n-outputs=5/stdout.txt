Steps:
1. Put the gripper just above the button 
2. Push down gently on the button
   
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    #  3. Move back up to initial position
    
    # First, place the gripper vertically aligned with the button.

The robot needs to push the button on the coffee machine.

# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper as viewed from above to the center of the button
    #  2. Push down on the button to push it
    # First, move the gripper above the button so that it is lined up with it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button")
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the button while pushing.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is closed, push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")


Steps:
1. Put gripper in front of the button 
2. Line up the gripper vertically with the button 
3. Push down on the button from the top 

if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button"): 
    robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button") 
if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"): 
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True) 
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"): 
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")


Here's the solution:

```
# coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine
# def coffee_button(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above button
    #  2. Drop gripper around button
    #  3. Push the button
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the button")
    # If the button isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not directly above the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the button but not near it, move the gripper
    # down to the button to push it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("just above the button", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the button, close the gripper and push the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button and the button is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("just above the button")
