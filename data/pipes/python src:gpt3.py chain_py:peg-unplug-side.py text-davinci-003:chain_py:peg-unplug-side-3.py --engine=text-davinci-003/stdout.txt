    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Pull the peg out from the side
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.

    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined
    # up with the hole, pull the peg out from the side.

        robot.pull("peg out from side")
