# dial-turn: turn the dial

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Close gripper around the dial

    # We need to put the gripper roughly above the dial before we can grab it, 
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.

    # all the way.

        robot.drop("gripper around dial")
    # As long as the gripper is still aligned with the dial and the gripper is
    # open, we can grab the dial by closing the gripper.
