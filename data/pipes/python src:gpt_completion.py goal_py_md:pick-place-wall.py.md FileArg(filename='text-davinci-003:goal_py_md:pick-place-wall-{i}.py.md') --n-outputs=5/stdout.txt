Here's the program written out:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move puck to target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move it above the puck while avoiding the wall in the way.

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck", avoid="wall")
    
If the robot's gripper is above the puck but not around it, move the gripper around the puck while avoiding the wall.

if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the puck", close_gripper=True, avoid="wall")

If the robot's gripper is around the puck but not near the target location, move it near the target location while avoiding the wall. 

if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location", close_gripper=True, avoid="wall")


1. Put gripper above puck  
2. Drop gripper around puck  
3. Line up gripper with the wall   
4. Move gripper below wall and pick up puck  
5. Move puck to goal

    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Now, we need to line up the gripper with the wall in order to trap the
    # puck between the wall and the gripper.
    # Move the gripper to a location that is close the wall, while still being
    # on the side of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with wall and the robot's gripper is not directly adjacent to the wall"):

    # Now move the gripper below the wall to trap the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with wall and the puck is not below the robot's gripper"):

    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing

We'll need to think of a way to get around the wall, since the robot has a single gripper. 

First, the robot should put the gripper above the puck, so that it doesn't accidently bump the wall while trying to grab the puck.

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Move gripper around the wall
    #  3. Drop gripper around puck
    #  4. Close gripper around puck
    #  5. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the puck, so that we don't bump the wall. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

Next, the robot should move the gripper around the wall, so that it is able to grab the puck. It should move the gripper to the left of the wall, so it can grab the puck from the right side. 

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Move gripper around the wall
    #  3. Drop gripper around puck
    #  4. Close gripper around puck
    #  5. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the puck, so that we don't bump the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # Next, move the gripper to the left of the wall, so the robot can grab the puck from the right side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the left of the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("to the left of the wall")
``` 

Now that the gripper is in position, the robot should drop it around the puck so it can be grabbed. 

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Move gripper around the wall
    #  3. Drop gripper around puck
    #
