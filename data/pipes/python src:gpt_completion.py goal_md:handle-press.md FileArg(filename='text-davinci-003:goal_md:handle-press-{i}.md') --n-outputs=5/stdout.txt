Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Push down on handle  3. Slide handle down
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the handle is not below the robot's gripper, push down the handle to slide it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the handle is not below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is directly above the handle
    If the handle is under the robot's gripper, push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is below the robot's gripper


Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, drop it around the handle. If the gripper isn't around the handle, move the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    If the robot's gripper is around the handle, push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Push gripper down  3. Push handle down
    The robot should put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    If the gripper isn't on the handle, it can push down on the handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    Now that the gripper is on the handle it can push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is above the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the handle is below the robot's gripper

    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down the handle
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertical alignment with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the handle, just push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the robot's gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle, drop the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed around the handle
    Now that the gripper is closed around the handle, we should be able to push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle
