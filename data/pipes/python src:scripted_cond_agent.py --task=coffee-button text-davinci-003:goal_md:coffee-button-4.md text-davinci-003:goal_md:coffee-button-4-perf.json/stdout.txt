    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push down on the button  3. Re-align the gripper in front of the button
    We need to line up the gripper in front of the button before we start pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the button, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
    After pushing the button, we need to re-align the gripper in front of the button so that the button won't get stuck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button
