To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper to left of the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should put the wrench around the peg.
