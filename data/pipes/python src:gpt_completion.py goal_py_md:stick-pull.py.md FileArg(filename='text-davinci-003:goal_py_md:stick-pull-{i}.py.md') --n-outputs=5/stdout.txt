    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the stick 
    #  2. Align the gripper with the stick
    #  3. Grip the end of the stick
    #  4. Move the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
    # To begin, move the gripper near the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the stick")
    # Next, we want to align the gripper with the stick, so that the robot can
    # grip the stick.

    if check("thermos is not near the target location and the robot's gripper is around the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


The steps of the program should be:
1. Put gripper above the stick
2. Drop gripper onto stick
3. Pull the stick towards the thermos
4. Put gripper in line with the thermos
5. Push the thermos to the target location

Solution: 
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper above the stick
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with stick")
    # 2. Drop gripper onto stick
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the stick")
    # 3. Pull the stick towards the thermos
    if check("the robot's gripper is around stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("towards the thermos")
    # 4. Put gripper in line with the thermos
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with thermos")
    # 5. Push the thermos to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


The stick pull program should do the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the stick
2. Grab the stick with the gripper
3. Place the end of the stick at the thermos
4. Pull the thermos towards the target location

```

    #  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    #  3. Place the end of the stick at the thermos
    #  4. Pull the thermos towards the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the stick")
    # If the stick isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper

    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the stick", close_gripper=True)

    # gripper to the end of the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not at the bottom of the stick and the robot's gripper is near the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("at the bottom of the stick")
    # Once the gripper is at the end of the stick, we should be able to slide it
    # under the thermos.
    if check("the robot's gripper is at the bottom of the stick and the thermos is not below the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the thermos")

    # thermos towards the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is below the thermos and the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


The program should look like this:
```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the top of the stick
    #  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    #  3. Pull the stick towards the target location
    #  4. Release the stick
    # Put the robot's gripper above the top of the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the top of the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the top of the stick")
    # Grab the stick with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the stick", close_gripper=True)
    # Pull the stick towards the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the stick and the the stick is not close to the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("towards the target location")
    # Release the stick
    if check("the stick is close to the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location", open_gripper=True)
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the stick
2. Drop gripper around the stick
3. Pull the stick towards the target location
4. Move the stick until the thermos is at the target location
