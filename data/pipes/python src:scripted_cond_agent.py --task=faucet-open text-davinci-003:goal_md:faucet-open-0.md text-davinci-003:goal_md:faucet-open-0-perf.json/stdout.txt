Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the faucet handle  2. Grip the handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the handle counter-clockwise  4. Push the handle to the left 

- When the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle 
- When the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed 
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the faucet handle is not counterclockwise, move the robot's gripper until the faucet handle is counterclockwise
- When the faucet is counterclockwise, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pointing left
