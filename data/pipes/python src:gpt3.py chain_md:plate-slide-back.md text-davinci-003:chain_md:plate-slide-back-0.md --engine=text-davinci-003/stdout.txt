    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Slide plate back to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is not near the plate, move it towards the plate until it is near the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should move gripper near plate.
    Once the gripper is near the plate, we can push the plate back.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should push plate back.
    Now that the plate is being pushed, keep pushing until it's back at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not at the goal, the robot should slide plate back to goal.
