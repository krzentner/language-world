# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):

# First, we need to detect the presence of the wall to make sure we don't run into it.
# We can use the robot's sensors to check for the wall and adjust our path accordingly.
# If the wall is detected, we need to move the gripper around the wall to push the puck.

if check("the wall is present"):
    robot.move("the gripper around the wall")

# Once we have moved around the wall, we can use the same code as the `push` function to slide the puck to the target location.
# We'll just add a check to make sure we are not hitting the wall as we slide the puck.
