    Steps:  1. Put gripper slightly above the forwall  2. Reach for wall above puck  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal using wall as lever
    First, put the gripper slightly above the wall. The wall will add some height, so this will get the gripper in the right spot to reach the puck while giving us a leverage point.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, try to reach the puck above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wall and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open
    When the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the puck
    When the gripper is above the puck and near the target location, push down on the wall to leverage the puck up, and then slide it over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall

    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the top of the wall  2. Place gripper above puck  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper on top of the wall near the puck. This will allow the robot to drop the puck around the wall when it's time to grab it, since the gripping axis of the robot's gripper should be perpendicular to the direction it moves in. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the top of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the top of the wall
    Then, put the gripper above the puck so that we can easily manipulate it without having to account for the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the puck and closed, we've likely trapped the puck and can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Move gripper around wall  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal
    First, we need to get the gripper above the puck. This can be difficult depending on the height of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the wall
    We can now move the robotic gripper to the other side of the wall. This can be difficult depending on its height.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall and is oriented toward the puck
    Once the gripper is above the wall and oriented toward the puck, move it until the gripper is above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location


Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Push the wall with the gripper  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, try pushing the wall before dragging the puck away.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the wall is no longer blocking the path to the goal
    If the wall has been pushed out of the way, just drag the puck away normally.
    - When the wall is no longer blocking the path to goal, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck 2. Drop gripper around puck 3. Close gripper around puck 4. Move puck over the wall
    First, line the gripper up with the puck from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper is below the wall, raise the gripper and try again. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is forward aligned with the wall, move the gripper until the gripper is around the puck
    Now that the gripper is around the puck, close the gripper and move the puck sideways over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed and the puck is below the wall, move the robot's gripper until the puck is above the wall and the robot's gripper is above the target location
