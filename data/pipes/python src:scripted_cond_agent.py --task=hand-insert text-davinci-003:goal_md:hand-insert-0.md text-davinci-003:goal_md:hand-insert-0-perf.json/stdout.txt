    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck 2. Trap the puck with the gripper 3. Move the puck to the target location
    Firstly, put the gripper roughly above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the robot's gripper is above the puck, trap it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, hold on to it while moving to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
