    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the side at an angle 
    First, put the gripper above the peg, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
    Once we have the peg, pull it out while turning at an angle pointing away from the original insertion holes.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at an angle away from the insertion hole
