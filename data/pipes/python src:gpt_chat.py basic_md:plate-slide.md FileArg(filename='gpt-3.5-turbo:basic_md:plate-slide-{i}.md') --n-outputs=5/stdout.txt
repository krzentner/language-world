To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should push the gripper into the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.

To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should place the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the plate is not near the target location, the robot should push the gripper into the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the target location.
To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location.
To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not in front of the robot, the robot should move the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not in front of the robot, the robot should move the plate in front of the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the plate is near the target location, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate reaches the target location, the robot should stop sliding and release the plate by opening the gripper.
