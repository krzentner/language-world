To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet knob  2. Turn the knob to the right to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper around the faucet knob.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob
    Once the gripper is around the knob, we can turn the knob to the right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob to the right to close the faucet
To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the faucet handle  2. Turn the gripper to the right to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can start turning to close the faucet.
    - While the faucet is not fully turned or the gripper is not fully right, continuously turn the gripper to the right until the faucet is fully closed.
To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around the faucet handle  3. Turn the handle to the right
    First, put the gripper mostly above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle
    If the gripper is near the faucet handle, we can turn the handle to the right to close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the handle is facing right. Then, close the gripper around the faucet handle and turn the handle to the right.
To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet knob  2. Turn right to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper around the faucet knob.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet knob and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob right until the faucet is closed.
To turn the faucet right, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Position gripper around right knob of the faucet  2. Grip the knob with the gripper and apply torque  3. Turn the knob until it is fully closed 
First, put the gripper around the right knob of the faucet.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the right knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the right knob
Once the gripper is around the knob, grip it tightly and apply torque to turn the knob.
- When the robot's gripper is around the right knob and the robot's gripper is open, close the robot's gripper
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the knob, apply torque to rotate the knob to the right until it is fully closed.
