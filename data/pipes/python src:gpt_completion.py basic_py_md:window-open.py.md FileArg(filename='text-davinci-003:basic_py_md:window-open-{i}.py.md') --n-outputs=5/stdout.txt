Complete code:

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
# def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")
```


The program should be as follows:

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
# def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")
``


 and your code should look like the following. 

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
#def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")
```


Below is the program for the window-open task:

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
# def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")
```



def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")
