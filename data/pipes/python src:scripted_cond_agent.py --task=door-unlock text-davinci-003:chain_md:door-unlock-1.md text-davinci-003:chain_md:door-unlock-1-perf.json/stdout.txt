    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the door lock  2. Move the dial using the gripper  3. Unlock the door
    First, put the gripper left of the door lock.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the door lock, the robot should move gripper left of door lock.
    If the robotâ€™s gripper is near the door lock, we can turn it by moving the gripper sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door lock, the robot should move the dial using the gripper.
    If the door lock is unlocking, try to open it.
    - When the door lock is unlocking, the robot should unlock the door.
