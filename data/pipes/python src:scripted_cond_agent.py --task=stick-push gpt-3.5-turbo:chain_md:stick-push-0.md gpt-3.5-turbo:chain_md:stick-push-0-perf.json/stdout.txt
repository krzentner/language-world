To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Position the stick above the thermos and align it with the center of the thermos  4. Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick
    First, position the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick.
    Grab the stick with the gripper and ensure that the gripper's jaw can tightly grip the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the gripper's jaw is not around the stick, the robot should grab the stick.
    Position the stick above the thermos and align it with the center of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not above the thermos or not aligned with the center of the thermos, the robot should position the stick accordingly.
    Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick, while ensuring that the stick maintains a good grip on the thermos.
    - When the stick is above the thermos and aligned with the center of the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
