    Steps:  1. Put the stick in the robot's gripper  2. Put the tip of the stick onto the thermos  3. Push the thermos to the target location
    First, put the stick into the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now the with the stick in the gripper, we want to put the tip of the stick onto the thermos.
    - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos
    Once the tip of the stick is touching the thermos, we can move the stick and push the thermos.
    - When the stick is touching the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
