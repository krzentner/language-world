    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place gripper above the ball.
    Then, drop the gripper around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the ball.
    Start pushing the ball with the gripper forward.
    - When robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is pushing forward, the robot should start the ball moving.
    Then, scoop up the ball and move toward the goal.
    - When robot's gripper is pushing the ball forward, the robot should move the ball toward goal.
