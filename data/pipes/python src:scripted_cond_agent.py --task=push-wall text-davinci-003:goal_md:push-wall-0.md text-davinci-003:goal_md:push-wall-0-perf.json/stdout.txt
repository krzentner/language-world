    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push puck against wall  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can push it against the wall. Push the puck against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is against the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
