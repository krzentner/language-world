    Steps:  1. Center the robot's gripper above the soccer ball  2. Push the robot's gripper into the soccer ball to trap it and hold it in place  3. Push the soccer ball in the direction of the goal
    First, the robot should position its gripper above, and centred on, the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not centred above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is centred above the soccer ball
    Next, the robot should push the gripper into the soccer ball to trap it, and then hold the soccer ball in fixed position.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in contact with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
