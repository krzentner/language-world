The steps the robot should perform are: 
1. Put gripper above the peg 
2. Grab the peg with the gripper 
3. Line the peg up with the hole 
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
- When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
- When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole
