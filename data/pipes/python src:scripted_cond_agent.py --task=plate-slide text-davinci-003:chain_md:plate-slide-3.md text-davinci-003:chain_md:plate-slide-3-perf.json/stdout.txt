    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Push plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the plate, we should be able to grab the plate by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not around plate, the robot should put gripper around plate. 
    Once the gripper is around the plate, we can just push the plate to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate, the robot should push plate to goal.
