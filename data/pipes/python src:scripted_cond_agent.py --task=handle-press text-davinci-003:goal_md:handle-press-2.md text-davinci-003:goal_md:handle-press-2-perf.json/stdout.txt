    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Push gripper down  3. Push handle down
    The robot should put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    If the gripper isn't on the handle, it can push down on the handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    Now that the gripper is on the handle it can push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is above the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the handle is below the robot's gripper
