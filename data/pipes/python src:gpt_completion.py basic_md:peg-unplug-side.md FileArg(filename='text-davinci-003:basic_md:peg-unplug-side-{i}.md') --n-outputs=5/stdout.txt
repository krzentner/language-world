    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should move gripper above peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not near peg, the robot should grab peg with its gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should twist the peg until it is aligned. 
    - When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should pull the peg out from the side.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is not left of the robot's gripper, the robot should rotate the peg to make it left of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the peg is left of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull peg out.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg, the robot should pull the peg out.


The robot should perform the following steps to pull the peg out from the side reliably: 
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
   - When the peg is too close to pull, the robot should grab the peg lower than its center. 
   - When the peg is far enough away, the robot should lift the peg up until the peg is at the same height of the board. 
   - When the robot's gripper is close enough to the board, the robot should pull the peg away from the board.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When the peg is not forward aligned with robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg and the peg is plugged in, the robot should pull the peg to the side and out.
