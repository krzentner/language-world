    Steps:  1. Reach towards the thermos  2. Place the stick end near the thermos  3. Push the thermos towards the goal 
    First, reach towards the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, the robot should reach to the thermos.
    Once the robot's gripper is near the thermos, position the stick end near the thermos and make sure it's ready to push.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should place the stick end near the thermos.
    Once the stick is near the thermos, push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal.

    Steps:  1. Put the stick in the robot's gripper  2. Reach towards the thermos  3. Push the thermos with stick  4. Move the thermos to goal
    First, the robot needs to pick up the stick. This can be done by finding the stick, and getting the robot's gripper near the stick, and then closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should reach towards the stick.
    When the gripper is near the stick, grab it and hold it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
    Now that the robot has the stick, and is out of the way of the thermos, it's time to push the thermos. Reach towards the thermos and use the stick to push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos and the stick is in the robot's gripper, the robot should reach towards thermos.
    As long as the stick and the thermos are still lined up, keep pushing towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is in the robot's gripper, the robot should push thermos with stick.
    When the thermos is near the goal, slide it over to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the target location is in sight, the robot should slide thermos to goal.


Steps:  1. Place the stick in front of the thermos close to the ground  2. Grab the stick with the gripper from the other side of the thermos  3. Push the stick forward and slide the thermos to the target
    First, we should put the stick in front of the thermos close to the ground. We want to make sure the stick is pointing towards the thermos and the gripper is near the stick.
    - When the stick is not in front of the thermos, the robot should put the stick in front of the thermos close to the ground.
    If the stick can be grabbed without bumping against the thermos, grab the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper can reach the stick without bumping against the thermos, the robot should grab the stick with the gripper.
    Once the stick is grasped, push the stick towards the target while moving the gripper back to keep the stick against the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is pushing across the thermos, the robot should push the stick forward and slide the thermos to the target.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Push the thermos to the target location
    To use the stick to push the thermos, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    With the stick in the gripper, we can push the thermos to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick, the robot should push thermos to target location.


Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos  4. Push the thermos to the target location
First, put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
If the stick becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick.
- When the stick is not left of the robot's gripper and the stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the stick.
Once the stick is lined up with the thermos and the gripper is still around the stick, push the thermos to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the thermos is not at the target location, the robot should push the thermos to the target location.
