    Steps:  1. Move gripper left of the wall  2. Put gripper in front of the button  3. Push button down 
    We'll need to move the robot's gripper around the wall before it can get to the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of wall and the robot's gripper is not near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is near the button
    When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is left of wall and the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the button, just push the button down
