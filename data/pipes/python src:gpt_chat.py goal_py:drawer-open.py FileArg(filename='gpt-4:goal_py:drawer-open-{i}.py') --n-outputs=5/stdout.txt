Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Sorry, there seems to be a mistake here. The function `drawer-open` has already been defined earlier in the code. Please disregard this duplicate, and let me know if you need any assistance with anything else!
Sorry, it looks like we already have a function called "drawer_open". Do you want me to provide a different function?
Sorry, it looks like the `drawer-open` function was already defined above. Do you need me to review it again, or is there something else you need help with?
It seems like you accidentally copied this function again instead of the "button-press-topdown" function. Here's the correct implementation for "button-press-topdown":

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
``` 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
I think there is a duplicate function in this code. The `drawer-open` function is already defined above. Maybe you meant to write `drawer-close` function?
