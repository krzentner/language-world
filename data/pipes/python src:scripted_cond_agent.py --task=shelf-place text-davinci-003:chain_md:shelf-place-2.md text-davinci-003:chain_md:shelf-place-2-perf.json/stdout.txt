    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Move the block to the target location  4. Place the block
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with block, the robot should put gripper above block.
    If the block isn't grabbed by the gripper, grab the block by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with block and the robot's gripper is not around block, the robot should close gripper around block.
    Now that the block is grabbed by the gripper, move the block to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around block, the robot should move block to target location.
    Once the block is above the target location, release the block.
    - When the block is above target location and the robot's gripper is holding block, the robot should place block.
