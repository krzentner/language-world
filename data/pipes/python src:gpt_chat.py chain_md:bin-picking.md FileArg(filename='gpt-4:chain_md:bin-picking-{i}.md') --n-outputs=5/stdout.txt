To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
2. Open the gripper and lower it around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper and lower it around the cube.
3. Close the gripper to grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper to grab the cube.
4. Lift and move the cube towards the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should lift it and move it towards the target bin.
5. Lower the cube into the bin and release the gripper to drop it.
- When the cube is above the target bin, the robot should lower it into the bin and release the gripper to drop it. 
6. Move the gripper away from the cube and bin.
- When the cube is in the bin and the gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper away from the cube and the bin.
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to target bin  5. Drop cube in target bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the cube to the target bin. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should drop cube in target bin.
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Detect cube and bin  2. Plan the grasp and movement trajectory  3. Move gripper to above the cube  4. Close gripper around the cube  5. Move gripper to above the target bin  6. Release the cube into the bin
    First, detect the cube and target bin, and plan the grasp and movement trajectory.
    - When the cube and target bin are not detected, the robot should search for them.
    Move the gripper to be above the cube, making sure that there is enough clearance between the gripper and the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper to be above the cube.
    Close the gripper around the cube until it is secure.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and is not closed, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
    Move the gripper to above the target bin with enough clearance to ensure the cube doesn't hit the bin on the way down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, the robot should move the gripper to be above the target bin.
    Release the cube into the target bin by opening the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and is not open, the robot should release the cube into the bin.
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Locate the cube and the target bin  2. Move gripper above the cube  3. Center the gripper above the cube  4. Move the gripper down and grab the cube  5. Lift the cube above the bin and center it over the bin  6. Move the gripper down and release the cube into the bin
    First, locate the cube and the target bin.
    - When the robot doesn't know the location of the cube or the target bin, the robot should locate the cube and the target bin.
    Move the gripper above the cube and center it directly above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not centered above the cube, the robot should center the gripper above the cube.
    Move the gripper down and grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper down and grab the cube.
    Lift the cube above the bin and center it over the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should lift the cube above the bin and center it over the bin.
    Move the gripper down and release the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper down and release the cube into the bin.
To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Lift the cube  4. Move the cube to the target bin  5. Release the cube into the target bin
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the cube is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should attempt to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the cube.
    Once the cube is in the gripper, lift the cube and move it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and holding the cube, the robot should lift the cube and move it to the target bin.
    Once the cube is above the target bin, release the gripper to drop the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, the robot should release the cube into the target bin.
