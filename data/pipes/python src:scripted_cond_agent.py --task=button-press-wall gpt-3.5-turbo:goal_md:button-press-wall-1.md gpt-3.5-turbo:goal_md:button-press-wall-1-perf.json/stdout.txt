The robot should perform the following steps to push the button from the front with a short wall in the way:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Move gripper forward until gripper is touching the wall  3. Slide gripper along the wall until gripper is above the button  4. Push down on the button from the front
First, put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
If the wall is in the way, move the gripper forward until it is touching the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not touching the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the wall
Slide the gripper along the wall until it is above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button and gripper is not sliding along the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sliding along the wall and the robot's gripper is above the button
Now that the gripper is above the button, push down on the button from the front to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
