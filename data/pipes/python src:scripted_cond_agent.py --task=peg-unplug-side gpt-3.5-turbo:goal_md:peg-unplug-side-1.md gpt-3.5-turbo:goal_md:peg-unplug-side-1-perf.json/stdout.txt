To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the side of the peg  2. Grab the peg with gripper  3. Pull the peg out sideways
    First, put the gripper near the side of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the side of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the side of the peg
    Once the gripper is near the peg and the peg is grabbed by the gripper, pull the peg out sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper has grabbed the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper has pulled the peg out sideways
