    Steps:  1. Line up the tip of the hammer with the nail  2. Push the hammer into the nail  3. Push the hammer away to hit the nail
    First, align the robot's gripper so that the tip of the hammer is lined up with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not lined up with the nail, the robot should line up the tip of the hammer with the nail.
    As long as the gripper is lined up to the nail, press down on the hammer to push it into the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is lined up with the nail and the hammer is not in contact with the nail, the robot should push the hammer into the nail. 
    If the nail is in contact with the hammer, push away from the nail to drive the nail.
    - When the hammer is in contact with the nail, the robot should push the hammer away from the nail to hit the nail.
