#lever-pull: rotate the lever up
#def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the lever handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to the right of lever handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the lever handle and it is not vertically aligned with it"):
        robot.put("gripper vertically aligned with lever handle")

        robot.push("the lever up")
``` 

This code should control the robot to move its gripper position to the lever handle,
align its gripper vertically with the lever handle, and finally push the lever up.
With these steps, it should successfully perform the task of `lever-pull`.
