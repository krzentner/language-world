    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around drawer handle  2. Push away from drawer 
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction since the drawer is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should grab drawer handle.
    If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, the robot should push away from drawer.
