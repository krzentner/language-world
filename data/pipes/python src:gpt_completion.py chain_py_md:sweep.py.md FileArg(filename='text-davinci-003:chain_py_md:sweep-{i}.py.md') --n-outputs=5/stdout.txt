Steps: 
1. Put gripper above cube
2. Drop gripper around cube
3. Close gripper around cube
4. Push the cube sideways to the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
    robot.place("gripper above cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.push("cube sideways to target location")


Steps:
  1. Put the gripper to the left of the cube
  2. Grab the cube
  3. Align the cube with the target location
  4. Slide the cube to the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not to the left of the cube"):
    robot.move("gripper to left of cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is to the left of the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.grab("cube")
if check("the cube is not aligned with the target location"):
    robot.align("cube to target")
if check("the cube is aligned with the target location"):
    robot.slide("the cube to the target location")


The code:

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Grab cube with gripper
    #  3. Move cube sideways to desired location
    # First, put the gripper above the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the cube sideways to the target location.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("cube to the target")
```


The steps for `sweep` are:

1. Put gripper above cube.
2. Drop gripper around cube.
3. Close gripper around cube.
4. Move sideways with cube to target location.

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move sideways with cube to target location
    # Place the gripper above the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube, grasp it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We grasped the cube, now move it sideways to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("sideways with cube to target location")
```


The program should be:

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Move the cube sideways to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("cube to goal")
```
