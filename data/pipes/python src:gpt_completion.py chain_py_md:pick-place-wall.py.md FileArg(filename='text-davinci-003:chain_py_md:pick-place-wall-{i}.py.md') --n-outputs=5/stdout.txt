Then, the code to control the robot should be written:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck, slightly behind wall
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move poked past wall to goal
    # First, put the gripper slightly above the puck, just behind the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind the wall and not above the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck and slightly behind wall")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck past the wall.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("puck past wall to goal")
```


Steps:
1. Line up the gripper with the wall
2. Put the gripper above the puck
3. Drop the gripper around the puck
4. Close the gripper around the puck
5. Move the puck to goal

    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the wall"):
        robot.align("gripper to the wall")
    # Put the gripper above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck to the goal, keeping the short wall in between.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")


Steps:
 1. Put gripper right of puck and wall
 2. Drop gripper around puck
 3. Slide puck away from wall and to side of wall
 4. Close gripper around puck
 5. Move puck around wall to goal

First, we need to put the gripper near the puck but not too close to the wall.
if check("the robot's gripper is not between the puck and the wall and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the puck"):
    robot.put("gripper right of puck and wall")

Once the gripper is between the puck and the wall, we can move the gripper to the side of pucks, to grab it.
if check("the robot's gripper is between the puck and wall and the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
    robot.drop("gripper around puck")

Next, we can slide the puck away from the wall and to the side of the wall.
if check("the puck is near the wall and the robot's gripper is around puck"):
    robot.slide("puck away from wall and to side of wall")

Now that the puck is in a position we can close the gripper to hold it.
if check("the puck is to the side of the wall and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around puck")

Finally, we can move the puck around the wall to the goal.
if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the puck and the goal is to the side of the wall"):
    robot.move("puck around wall to goal")

Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Move gripper to center of wall
3. Drop gripper along short wall
4. Close gripper around puck
5. Move puck to the goal
