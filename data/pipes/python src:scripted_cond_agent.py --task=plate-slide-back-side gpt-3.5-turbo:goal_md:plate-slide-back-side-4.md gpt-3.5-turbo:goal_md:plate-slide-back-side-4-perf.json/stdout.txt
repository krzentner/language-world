To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper back until the plate is almost at the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location

First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
If the plate is not yet close to the target location, move the gripper and plate back.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not almost at the target location, move the robot's gripper back until the plate is almost at the target location
If the gripper is aligned with the plate and the plate is almost at the target location, we can slide the plate into the target location.
- When the plate is almost at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is lined up with the target location and the gripper is open
If the gripper is lined up with the target location, close the gripper to make sure the plate stays in place.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed.
