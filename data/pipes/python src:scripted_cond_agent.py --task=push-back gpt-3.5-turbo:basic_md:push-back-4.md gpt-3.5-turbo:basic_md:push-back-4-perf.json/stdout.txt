To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper, the robot should lift the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the puck is lifted, the robot should slide the puck backwards towards the target location.
- When the puck is at the target location and the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the puck.
