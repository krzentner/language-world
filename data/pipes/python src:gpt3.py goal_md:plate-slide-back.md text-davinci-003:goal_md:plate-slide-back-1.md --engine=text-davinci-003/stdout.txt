    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Drop gripper around the plate  3. Slide the plate back 
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not around the plate, move the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and closed, we can slide the plate back by moving the gripper back.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
