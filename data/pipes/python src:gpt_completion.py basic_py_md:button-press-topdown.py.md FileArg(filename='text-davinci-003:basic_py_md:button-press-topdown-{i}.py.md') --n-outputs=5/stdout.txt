# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")


Great, here is the program: 

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
    robot.put("gripper above button")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
    robot.push("down on button")


If check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
    robot.put("gripper above button")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
    robot.push("down on button")


The code would look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
