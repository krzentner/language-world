To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Position the stick next to the thermos  2. Push the thermos towards the goal with the stick
    First, position the stick next to the thermos, so that the robot can push the thermos without knocking it over.
    - When the robot's stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick near the thermos.
    Once the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal by using the stick.
    - When the robot's stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal with the stick.
