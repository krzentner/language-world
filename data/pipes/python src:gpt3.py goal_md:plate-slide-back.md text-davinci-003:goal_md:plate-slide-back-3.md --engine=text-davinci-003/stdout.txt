    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push the plate back into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate, move the gripper until it is near the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is in front of the plate, we can start pushing it back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
