To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Move gripper so that it is vertically aligned with the handle  3. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move gripper near the handle.
    Next, move the gripper so that it is vertically aligned with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should move gripper to align with handle.
    Once the gripper is aligned with the handle, push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on handle.
