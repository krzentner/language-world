Steps:  1. Put gripper around the drawer handle  2. Push the drawer closed
    We just need to put the gripper around the drawer handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle
