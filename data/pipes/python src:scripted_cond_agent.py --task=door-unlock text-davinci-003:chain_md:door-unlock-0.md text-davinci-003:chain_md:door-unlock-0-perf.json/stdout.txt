    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the door handle  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Line the dial up with the risk  4. Rotate dial to the right  5. Release the dial
    First, put the gripper above the door handle so that we can grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
    When the gripper is above the dial, we can close the gripper to grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab dial.
    Now that we have the dial in the gripper, we can line up the dial with the risk.
    - When the robot's gripper is above dial and the dial is not aligned with risk, the robot should align dial with risk.
    Once the dial is lined up with the risk, rotates the dial to the right until it stops.
    - When the dial is aligned with the risk, the robot should rotate dial right.
    Finally, release the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial, the robot should release dial.
