    Steps:  1. Put gripper just above the wall to the side of the button  2. Push down on the button from the top
    We need to put the gripper to the side is because the short wall is in the way. We'll need to put the gripper near the wall and slightly above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should place gripper just above the wall to the side of button.
    Once the gripper is in position, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall, the robot should push down on button.
