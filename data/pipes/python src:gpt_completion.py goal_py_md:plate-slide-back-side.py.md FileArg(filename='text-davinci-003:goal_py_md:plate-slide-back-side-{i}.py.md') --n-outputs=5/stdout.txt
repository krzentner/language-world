Steps:
  1. Put gripper in front of the plate
  2. Line up the plate with the target location
  3. Slide the plate backwards into the target location

If the robot's gripper is not in front of the plate, move it to the plate.
```

# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of the plate
    #  2. Line up the plate with the target location
    #  3. Slide the plate backwards into the target location
    # If the robot's gripper is not in front of the plate, move it to the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("in front of the plate")
    # Once the gripper is in front of the plate, we need to line it up with the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
    # If the plate is lined up with the target location, we can slide it back
    # into the target location.
    if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate")


The steps for this task are: 
1. Put gripper slightly left of the plate 
2. Slide the plate with the gripper (right side moving) back into the target location

The code would look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper slightly left of the plate
    #  2. Slide the plate with the gripper (right side moving) back into the target location
    # If the robot's gripper is not slightly left of the plate, move it there.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not slightly left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("slightly left of the plate")
    # Once the gripper is slightly left of the plate, start sliding the plate
    # back with the right side of the plate moving.
    if check("the robot's gripper is slightly left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the target location", close_gripper=True)
    # If the plate is close enough to the target location, we can just push
    # it in sideways.
    if check("the plate is near the target location"): 
        robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")
```


    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the plate 
    #  2. Grab the plate and slide it back into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
    # If the plate is left of the robot's gripper, open the gripper and move it
    # around the plate.
    if check("the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not open"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the plate, slide it back into the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("backward of the target location")


Steps:

1. Put gripper near the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Slide the plate back sideways towards the target location

If the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move it to the plate. Then grab the plate with the gripper.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
```

Now we can start sliding the plate backwards towards the target location. To do that, we first need to make sure the plate is horizontally aligned with the target.

```
if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target")
```

Finally, we can push the plate sideways into the target location.

```
if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the target and the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("away from the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper forward of the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Move the plate until it's aligned with the target location
4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location

If the robot's gripper is not forward of the plate, move the gripper near the plate to start sliding.

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper forward of the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Move the plate until it's aligned with the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    # If the robot's gripper is not forward of the plate, move the gripper near the plate to start sliding.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward of the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the plate is now left of the robot's gripper, move the plate until it's aligned with the target location.
    if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, slide it sideways into the target location.
    if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")
