    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the hammer  2. Grab the hammer  3. Look for the nail  4. Line up the hammer with the nail  5. Move the gripper downwards to strike the nail
    First, put the gripper above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, the robot should put gripper above hammer.
    Now, grab the hammer and look for the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is not on the hammer, the robot should grab hammer.
    Once the hammer is lined up with the nail, move the gripper downwards to strike.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the hammer and the hammer is aligned with the nail, the robot should move gripper downwards to strike nail.
