    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper is not around the puck, put the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is near the puck, we can grab the puck by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
