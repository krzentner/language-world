2. Keep moving the gripper towards the target location until it reaches the goal location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following step:

1. Reach towards the target: We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location. When the robot's gripper is not near the reach target, the robot should reach to the goal.
