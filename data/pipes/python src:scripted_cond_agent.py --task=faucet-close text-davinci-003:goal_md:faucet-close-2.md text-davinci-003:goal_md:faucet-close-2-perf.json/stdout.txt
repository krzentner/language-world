    Steps:  1. Line up gripper as seen from above  2. Grab the handle and pull it right  3. Pull it firmly
    First we need to line up the robot's gripper above the faucet's handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, grab the handle with the gripper and pull it right.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the handle is not to the right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the handle is to the right of the robot's gripper
    Finally, pull the handle firmly to close the faucet.
    - When the handle is to the right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
