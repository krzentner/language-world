The program would look like this:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole
    #  2. Drop griper around peg
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    #  4. Move peg out of hole
    # First, put the gripper above the hole, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above the hole")
    # If the gripper is not around the peg, put it around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is near the peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    # We closed the gripper, the peg should still be near the gripper, so let's
    # try to move the peg out of the hole.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("peg out of the hole")
