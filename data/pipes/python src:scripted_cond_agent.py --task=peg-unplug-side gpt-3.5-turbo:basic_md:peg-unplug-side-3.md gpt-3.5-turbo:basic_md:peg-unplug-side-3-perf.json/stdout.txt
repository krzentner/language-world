To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
