Steps:  1. Put gripper near front of plate  2. Push gripper into plate  3. Slide plate backward 
    We need to push the plate backward, so put the gripper near the front of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near front of plate, the robot should put gripper near front of plate.
    Now that we have the gripper in place near the front of the plate, we can push the gripper into the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not inside plate and the robot's gripper is not pushing against plate, the robot should push gripper into plate.
    Once we have the gripper pushing against the plate, we will be able to slide it backward as we move the gripper backward.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside plate, the robot should slide plate backward.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push plate back  3. Place plate at target
    We need to place the gripper above the plate, in order to be able to grab the plate and slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, the robot should push the plate back.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not closer to target, the robot should push plate back.
    When the plate is close to the target location, place the plate with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is closer the target, the robot should place plate at target.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate back into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Now that the gripper is above the plate, we should be able to grab the plate by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around plate.
    Once the gripper is around the plate, we can start pushing it back towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate and the plate is not aligned with target, the robot should align plate to target.
    Once the plate is aligned with the target, we can slide it back.
    - When the plate is aligned with the target, the robot should slide back plate into the target.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of the plate  2.Get shaped fingers or suction cup onto the plate  3. Slide the plate towards the target location
    To get the gripper onto the plate, put the gripper onto the edge of the plate so that the gripper has a hold of the plate.
    -When the robot's gripper is not on top of plate and the plate is away from the target location, the robot should put gripper on top of plate.
    If the gripper is on the plate and it's still far from target location, use shaped fingers or suction cup to get grip on the plate.
    -When the robot's gripper is on top of plate and the plate is not gripped, the robot should get shaped fingers or suction cup onto plate. 
    Once the plate is being gripped, slide the plate back towards the target location.
    -When the robot's gripper is on top of plate and the plate is gripped, the robot should slide plate towards target location.

Steps:  1. Put gripper behind the plate  2. Push the plate back  3. Slide the plate
    If the robot's gripper is not behind the plate, we should move the gripper near the back side of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind the plate and the robot's gripper is below the plate, the robot should move gripper behind plate.
    If the robot's gripper is at the back side of the plate, we should be able to slide the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the plate, the robot should push plate back.
    If the plate has moved back a bit, the robot can slide it into place.
    - When the plate is pushed back, the robot should slide plate.
