Here are the steps that the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:

1. Put gripper left of the window handle.
If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, the gripper should be moved near the window handle to start pushing.

2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window.
The robot should start pushing against the window handle to slide the window closed.

3. Push the window closed harder.
If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, the robot should push harder to slide the window closed.

We have also provided similar steps for other tasks in this list.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.
