Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Pull the plate towards the target location  3. Push the plate into the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate
- When the robot's gripper is left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the target location
