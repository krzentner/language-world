To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the block, the robot should lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the block at the target location by opening the gripper.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
  - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower the gripper to hold the block.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the gripper is not vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper to be vertically aligned with the target location.
  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should release the block to place it at the target location.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower the gripper and close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the block by opening the gripper and placing the block at the target location.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should move gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the block, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block, the robot should close the gripper to pick up the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block and not above the target location, the robot should move gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and holding the block, the robot should release the block by opening the gripper to place it at the target location.

- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the block at the target location.
