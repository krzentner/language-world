To insert the peg into the hole reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line the peg up with the hole
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole

Here are the more detailed explanations for each step:
1. First, put the gripper above the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Once the gripper is above the peg, grab the peg with the gripper.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. As long as the gripper is mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
   - When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and not forward-aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.
   - When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg.

4. Once the gripper is above the peg positioned over the hole, slide the peg sideways into the hole.
   - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole.
