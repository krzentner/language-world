Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the door handle  2. Start pushing against the door handle to close the door  3. Push the door closed harder  4. Move door handle to target location
- When the door handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should move gripper to left of door handle. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, the robot should slide door right. 
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle, the robot should push door right harder. 
- When the door handle is close to the target location, the robot should move door handle to target location.
