For the `box-close` task, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the box  4. Place the box lid on top of the box  5. Release the gripper and move away from the box 

First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't around the box lid yet, put it around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the box lid, move the gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
Once the gripper is above the box, gently lower the box lid onto the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is not touching the box, move the robot's gripper until the box lid touches the box
Finally, release the gripper and move away from the box.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the box lid, release the gripper and move the robot's gripper away from the box.
To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above box lid  2. Drop gripper around box lid  3. Close gripper around box lid  4. Move the gripper above the box  5. Drop gripper on top of the box  6. Open gripper to release the lid on top of the box

First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the box lid and closed, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
If the gripper is above the box, we should drop the lid on top of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper down until the gripper is on top of the box lid
Finally, open the gripper to release the box lid on top of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is on top of the box lid, open the gripper to release the lid on top of the box.
To close the box with the lid, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lid  2. Drop gripper around lid  3. Close gripper around lid  4. Move lid to box  5. Open gripper to release lid
    First, put the gripper above the lid, so that we don't bump into it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lid
    If the gripper isn't around the lid, put it around the lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the lid and closed, we can grab it by lifting it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
    If the gripper is above the box, we can place the lid on top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box with the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open to release the lid onto the box.
To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the box lid 
2. Drop gripper around the box lid 
3. Close gripper around the box lid 
4. Move the lid to the top of the box 
5. Release the lid by opening the gripper

First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the box lid and closed, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper. Once the gripper is closed around the box lid, lift the lid and place it on top of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the top of the box
Finally, release the lid by opening the gripper when it's in the correct position on the top of the box.
To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the box lid
2. Grab the box lid with the gripper
3. Move the gripper to the top of the box
4. Release the box lid onto the box

First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't already closed around the lid, grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
Next, move the gripper to the top of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is around the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
Finally, release the box lid onto the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box, release the box lid onto the box.
