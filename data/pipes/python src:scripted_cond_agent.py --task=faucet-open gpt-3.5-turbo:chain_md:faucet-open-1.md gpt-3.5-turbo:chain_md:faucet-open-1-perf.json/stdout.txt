To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the gripper above the faucet handle  2. Orient the gripper to grasp the handle  3. Turn the handle left to open the faucet
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above the faucet handle.
    Orient the gripper to grasp the handle by moving it closer to the handle and lining it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and not oriented to grasp the handle, the robot should orient gripper to grasp handle.
    Begin turning the handle by rotating the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is oriented to grasp the handle and not turned left, the robot should turn handle left by rotating gripper left.
