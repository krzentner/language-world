    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Push down on the dial  3. Turn the dial
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
    Once the gripper is above the dial, put it down on top of the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is on top of the dial, we can turn it by pushing down and twisting.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the desired position
