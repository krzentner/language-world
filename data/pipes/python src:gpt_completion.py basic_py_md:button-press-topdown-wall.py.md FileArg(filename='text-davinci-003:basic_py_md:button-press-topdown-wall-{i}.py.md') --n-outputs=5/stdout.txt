Using model: text-davinci-003


The code should be:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and there is a wall in the way"):
        robot.move("gripper above the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
   robot.reach("top of the wall") 
if check("the robot's gripper is not above button"):
   robot.put("gripper above the button") 
if check("the robot's gripper is above button and the robot is not on top of the wall"):
    robot.climb("onto the top of the wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is above button and the robot is on top of the wall"):
   robot.push("down on button")


if check("the robot's gripper is not near the button and the robot's gripper is not directly above the button"):
    robot.put("gripper directly above button")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is not above the wall blocking the button"):
    robot.put("gripper above the wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.put("gripper above the button")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around the button")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.push("down on the button")


if check("the robot's gripper is not next to the wall and not vertically aligned with the button"):
    robot.put("gripper next to the wall above the button")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and not near the button"):
    robot.grab("gripper above the wall and push towards the button")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the button"):
    robot.push("button down")


The program should look like this:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not close to the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper near the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.reach("over the wall to the button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
