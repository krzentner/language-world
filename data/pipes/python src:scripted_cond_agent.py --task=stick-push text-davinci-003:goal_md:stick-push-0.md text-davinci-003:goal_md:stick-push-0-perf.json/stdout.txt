    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Hold the stick  4. Push the thermos with the stick
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    After the gripper is above the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper is around the stick, we can hold the stick by moving the gripper away from the thermos, while keeping it against the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is far enough away from the thermos that it has a good grip on the stick
    Now that the robot's gripper has a good grip on the stick, we can push the thermos until it reaches the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is far enough away from the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the thermos is at the target location
