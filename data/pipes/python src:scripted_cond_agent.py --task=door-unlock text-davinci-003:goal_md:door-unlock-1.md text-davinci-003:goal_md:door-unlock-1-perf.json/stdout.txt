    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Move the gripper in a circular motion around the dial  3. Turn the dial to unlock the door
    We need to put the gripper near the dial before we can move it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is in place, turn the dial in a circle to unlock the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial, move the robot's gripper in a circular motion until the robot's gripper has turned the dial to the correct position to unlock the door
