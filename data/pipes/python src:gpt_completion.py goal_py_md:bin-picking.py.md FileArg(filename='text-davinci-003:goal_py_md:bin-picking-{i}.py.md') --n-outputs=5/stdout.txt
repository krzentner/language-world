The steps for bin-picking would be as follows:

1. Locate the cube using the robot's sensors
2. Put the gripper above the cube
3. Align the gripper with the cube from above
4. Close the gripper around the cube
5. Pick up the cube
6. Move the cube to the target bin and release it

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Grab the cube with the gripper
    #  3. Move the cube up
    #  4. Move the cube to the target bin
    # First, put the gripper above the cube, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the cube", close_gripper=True)

    # the gripper.

    # cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target bin and the cube is in the gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("open", close_gripper=False)


Steps:
 1. Put the gripper above the cube
 2. Drop the gripper around the cube
 3. Close the gripper around the cube
 4. Move the cube towards the bin
 5. Drop the cube into the bin

    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the cube and the cube is near the target bin"):

Steps:
1. Put gripper near the cube
2. Grab the cube with the gripper
3. Move the gripper to the target bin
4. Put the cube down in the bin

if check("the robot's gripper is near the target bin"):

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above cube
2. Drop gripper around cube
3. Close gripper around cube
4. Line up the cube with its target bin 
5. Move the cube into bin
