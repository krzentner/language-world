To push the door closed to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly above the door handle  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not above the door handle, move it to the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the door handle, the robot should place gripper above door handle.
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, the robot should push door closed.
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper on the door handle
If the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should move gripper to the door handle.

2. Push the door closed
If the door is aligned with the gripper, push it closed.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the door and the door is not completely closed, the robot should push the door closed. 

3. Check if the door is closed
If the door is not completely closed, go back to step 2. If it is closed, the task has been completed.
Unfortunately, since the task `door-close` wasn't defined in the original prompt, I cannot provide specific steps to complete the task. Can you please provide more information about the task and the robot's capabilities?
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper near the door handle
2. Push the door closed
3. Repeat as necessary until the door is closed

If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should put gripper near the door handle.

If the door is not fully closed, push it closed.
- When the door is not fully closed, the robot should push the door closed.

Repeat the above steps until the door is closed.

It is important to note that the robot should use enough force to push the door closed, but not too much force to damage the door or surrounding area. Additionally, the robot should sense the position of the door and the force being applied to avoid collisions or any damage.
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put the gripper roughly around the door handle 2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should grab the door handle.
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from behind, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is backward aligned with the door handle, the robot should push the door closed.
