# def coffee_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the robot's gripper above the mug handle 
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the mug handle 
    #  3. Close the gripper around the mug handle 
    #  4. Pull the mug towards the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the mug handle. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug handle")
    # Once the gripper is above the mug handle, we can drop the gripper around
    # the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around mug handle")
    # If the gripper is near the mug handle and still open, let's try to close
    # the gripper.

        robot.close("gripper around mug handle")

    # Try to pull the mug towards the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is near the robot's gripper"):
