The robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, the robot should move gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not near handle, the robot should push gripper towards handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should push handle down.


The task `handle-press-side` requires the robot to push down the handle from the side reliably. To do that, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper at the side of handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on handle.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper forward of handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle, the robot should align gripper to handle.
    - When gripper is next to handle, the robot should push down on handle.
 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should put gripper around handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should push the handle down.

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper next to handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not next the handle, the robot should move gripper to the side of handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is next to handle, the robot should push handle down.
