To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle of the mug  2. Lift the mug off the table  3. Move the mug to the target location by pulling it towards the target location
    First, put the gripper around the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug and above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, lift the mug off the table.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle of the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the table and the mug is lifted off the table
    Move the mug to the target location by pulling it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the table and the mug is lifted off the table, move the robot's gripper until the mug is pulled towards the target location. The robot may need to partially open and close the gripper to ensure the mug does not slip. Once at the target location, place the mug down by opening the gripper.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the handle of the mug  2. Lift and slide the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper around the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, lift the mug and slide it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, lift and slide the mug until the mug is at the target location
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Hold the mug with the gripper  4. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle to prepare for holding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    Once the gripper is above the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is holding the mug, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is resting on the target location. Finally, release the mug by opening the gripper.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper around the handle of the mug
2. Lift up the mug to clear the table
3. Move the gripper towards the target location
4. Lower the mug to the target location

First, put the gripper around the handle of the mug. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, lift up the mug to clear the table.
- When the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is not lifted, move the robot's gripper upwards until the mug is lifted
Next, move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is not near it, move the robot's gripper until the mug is near the target location
Finally, lower the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper downwards until the mug is resting on the target location.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper  3. Lift the mug up slightly  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Lower the mug to the target location
First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the mug handle, lift the mug up slightly to ensure a good grip.
- When the robot's gripper has a grip on the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the mug is above the target location at a safe height for transport
If the robot's gripper is above the target location and at the safe height for transport, move the mug to the target location.
- When the mug is above the target location and at the safe height for transport, move the robot's gripper until the mug is at the target location and at a safe height for placement
Finally, lower the mug to the target location.
