# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location

    #  2. Drop the gripper around the handle of the mug
    #  3. Close the gripper around the mug handle
    #  4. Lift the mug off the surface
    #  5. Move the mug to the target location
    #  6. Release the mug onto the target location
