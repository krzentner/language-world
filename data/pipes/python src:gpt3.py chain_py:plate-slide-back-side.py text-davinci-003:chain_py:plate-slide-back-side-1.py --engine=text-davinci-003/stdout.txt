    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Line the plate up with the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate sideways backwards
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.

    # If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the plate.
    # Because the plate is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.

        robot.grab("plate")

    # up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.align("plate to target location")
    # If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, insert it.
