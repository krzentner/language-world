The program should be:

```
# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the window handle")
```


Then complete the program as follows:

```
# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the 
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the window handle")
```


... and add the following code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the window handle")
```


Here is the program: 

```

# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the window handle")
```
