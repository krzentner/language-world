To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around the mug handle
3. Close gripper around the mug handle
4. Check if mug is stable in gripper
5. Move gripper above target location
6. Release gripper to drop mug at target location

First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Check if the mug is stable in the gripper. Make sure it's not slipping or falling.
- If the mug is not stable in the gripper, adjust the gripper until the mug can be held securely.
Once the mug is securely held in the gripper, move the gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the mug handle and the target location is not below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
Finally, release the gripper to drop the mug at the target location.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the mug handle 
           2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper 
           3. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the mug handle, we can hold the mug and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Make sure that the mug is stable and can't spill as the robot moves it to the target location. Once it's in position, release the gripper to set the mug down.
For the `coffee-push` task, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle of the mug
2. Drop gripper around mug handle
3. Close the gripper around mug handle
4. Move the mug to target location
5. Place the mug down and release the gripper

First, put the gripper above the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle.
Once the gripper is above the handle, move the gripper down to the handle to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed.
Once the gripper is holding the mug, move the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the mug is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper and the mug until the mug is at the target location.
Finally, place the mug down and release the gripper.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the mug
2. Lower the gripper onto the mug and close the gripper around the mug to grasp it
3. Lift the mug and move it towards the target location
4. When the mug is above the target location, lower the gripper and release the mug

First, put the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug
If the gripper is not near the mug, move the gripper near the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is not near the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close enough to the mug to pick it up
When the gripper is close enough to the mug to pick it up, grasp the mug by closing the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper down onto the mug and close the gripper around it
After grasping the mug with the gripper, lift it and move it towards the target location.
- While the mug is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper and the mug together towards the target location
When the mug is above the target location, lower the gripper and release the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed around the mug, move the robot's gripper down onto the target location and release the mug by opening the gripper
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Lift the mug off the table  4. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug
    If the mug becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the mug.
    - When mug is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the mug, lift it off the table.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the mug is still on the table, move the robot's gripper up until the mug is lifted off the table
    Once the mug is lifted off the table, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and the mug is off the table, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
