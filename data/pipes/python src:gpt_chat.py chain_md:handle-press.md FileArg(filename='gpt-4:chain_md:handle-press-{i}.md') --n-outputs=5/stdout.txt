To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle, the robot should push down on handle.
To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Push down on the handle
   First, put the gripper above the handle, making sure it is aligned as closely as possible.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
   Once the gripper is aligned above the handle, just push down on the handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on handle.
To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle, grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should grab handle.
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should push down on handle.
To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    If the handle is within reach of the gripper, grab it.
    - When the handle is within reach of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    Push down on the handle with the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle, the robot should push down on the handle.
The following steps can be taken to reliably push down the handle:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle and open, close the gripper to make sure we have control of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push down on the handle.
