Sorry, I made a mistake earlier in mentioning the task `door-close`. It seems that the description of the task was missing. 

Assuming that the task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door closed to the target location in a reliable manner, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is below the door handle, the robot should move gripper to right of door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, the robot should put gripper around the door handle with a firm grip.
- When the robot's gripper is around the door handle and the door is not closed, the robot should push the door closed towards the target location using a moderate force. 
- Lastly, when the door is closed, the robot should release the grip of its gripper on the door handle.
