    Steps:  1. Put gripper at the side of the handle 2. Grab handle with gripper 3. Pull up handle
    First, put the gripper somewhere on the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the side of the handle, the robot should put gripper at the side of the handle.
    If the gripper is now at the side of the handle, we can try to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    After we have grabbed the handle, we can now try to pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull up handle.
