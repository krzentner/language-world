Here are the steps the robot should perform for the `stick-pull` task:

1. Put the gripper near the top of the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the top of the stick.
2. Close the gripper around the stick to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is near the top of the stick and open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick to grab it.
3. Put the gripper near the thermos handle.
- When the gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the thermos handle.
4. Use the stick to hook onto the thermos handle.
- When the gripper is near the thermos handle, the robot should use the stick-like a hook to grab onto the thermos handle.
5. Pull the thermos towards the target location, using the stick.
- When the stick is hooked onto the thermos handle, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location.
6. Release the gripper to let go of the stick.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the gripper to let go of the stick.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the bottom of the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Move the stick to hook the thermos handle  4. Pull the stick and the thermos towards the target location
    First, put the gripper near the bottom of the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the bottom of the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the bottom of the stick.
    Once the gripper is near the bottom of the stick, close the gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the bottom of the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
    Move the stick so that it hooks onto the thermos handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the stick and the stick is not hooked onto the thermos handle, the robot should move the stick to hook the thermos handle.
    Pull the stick and the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the stick is hooked onto the thermos handle, the robot should pull the stick and the thermos towards the target location.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Hold stick above thermos  2. Position stick so that it is hooked onto the handle of the thermos  3. Pull the stick towards the target location to slide the thermos
    First, hold the stick above the thermos, with the hook end pointing towards the thermos and the other end towards the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the thermos, the robot should hold the stick above the thermos.
    Move the stick down so that it hooks onto the handle of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not hooked onto the thermos and the stick is above the thermos, the robot should hook the stick onto the handle of the thermos.
    With the stick hooked onto the thermos, pull the stick towards the target location to slide the thermos to the target.
    - When the stick is hooked onto the thermos and the stick is not towards the target location, the robot should pull the stick towards the target location.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Position the gripper above the stick.
2. Grab the stick with the gripper.
3. Move the stick towards the thermos until it comes in contact with it.
4. Use the stick to hook onto the handle of the thermos.
5. Pull the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
6. Once the thermos reaches the target location, release the stick and drop the thermos.

- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should position gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the stick is not in contact with the thermos, the robot should move stick towards the thermos.
- When the stick comes in contact with the thermos, the robot should use the stick to hook onto the handle of the thermos.
- When the thermos is hooked, the robot should pull the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the stick and drop the thermos.
To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the thermos 2. Grab the stick with the gripper 3. Position the stick to pull the thermos 4. Pull the thermos to the target location

First, put the gripper near the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, the robot should place the gripper near the thermos.

Once the gripper is near the thermos, grab the stick with the gripper.
- When the stick is near the gripper and the gripper is open, the robot should pick up the stick with the gripper.

Position the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location. The robot should make sure that the stick is wedged underneath the thermos before pulling.
- When the stick is in position to wedge under the thermos, the robot should wedge the stick under the thermos.

Pull the thermos towards the target location by moving the gripper in the direction of the target location while holding the stick in place.
- When the robot's gripper holding the stick is in the direction of the target location, the robot should slowly pull the thermos towards the target location while holding the stick in place.
