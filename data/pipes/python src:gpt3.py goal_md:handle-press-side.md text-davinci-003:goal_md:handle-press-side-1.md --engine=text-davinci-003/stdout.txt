    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Move the gripper to the side of the handle  3. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, move the gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not left of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the handle
    If the gripper is left of the handle, we can push down on it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
