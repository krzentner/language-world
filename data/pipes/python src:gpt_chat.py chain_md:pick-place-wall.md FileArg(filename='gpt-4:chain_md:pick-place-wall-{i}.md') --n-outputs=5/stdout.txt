To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Move gripper over wall  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal
First, put the gripper above the puck, like in the pick-place task.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
Now, move the gripper over the wall. This might involve some movement in multiple dimensions to get the gripper over the wall while still being properly aligned with the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not over the wall, the robot should carefully move the gripper over the wall.
Once the gripper is over the wall, drop the gripper around the puck and close it around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is over the wall and not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck and close gripper around puck.
Once the puck is grabbed, move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck and above the top of the wall, the robot should move puck to goal.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move gripper to wall and place puck over the wall at target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot, the robot should place gripper above puck on the same side of the wall.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, we probably have the puck. Move the gripper over the wall to place the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should move gripper over the wall and place puck at target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
   1. Put gripper above puck
   2. Drop gripper around puck
   3. Close gripper around puck
   4. Lift gripper and puck over the wall
   5. Move gripper and puck to goal
   6. Lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location

First, put the gripper above the puck, so that we do not hit the wall while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
If the gripper is close to the puck, close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.
Now that we have the puck, we need to lift it over the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper and the puck is near the wall, the robot should lift the gripper and puck over the wall.
Move the gripper and puck to the target location.
    - When the robot and puck are lifted over the wall towards the target location, the robot should move gripper and puck to goal.
Once we reach the target location, we should lower the gripper and release the puck to place it at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper and puck have reached the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and release the puck.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck on the near side of the wall
   We need to put the gripper above the puck on the near side of the wall so that we can grab it.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck on the near side of the wall, the robot should place the gripper above the puck on the near side of the wall.

2. Drop gripper around puck and lift it over the wall
   Once we have the gripper above the puck, we need to drop the gripper around it and lift it up over the wall.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the puck on the near side of the wall and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck and lift it up over the wall.

3. Put gripper above target on the far side of the wall
   Now that we have the puck on the far side of the wall, we need to put the gripper above the target.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the target on the far side of the wall, the robot should place the gripper above the target on the far side of the wall.

4. Lower gripper and release puck at target location
   Finally, we need to lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the target on the far side of the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location.
The robot needs to perform the following steps for the task `pick-place-wall`:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to wall  5. Move gripper over the wall to the other side  6. Lower gripper down to place puck at goal
The first three steps are identical to the `pick-place` task, so we can reuse them. After the gripper has closed around the puck, the robot needs to move the puck to the short wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around puck and the puck is not yet at the wall, the robot should move puck to wall.
Next, the robot needs to move the gripper over the wall to the other side.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should move the gripper over the wall to the other side.
Finally, the robot needs to lower the gripper down to place the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall and above the goal, the robot should place the puck at the goal location by lowering the gripper down.
