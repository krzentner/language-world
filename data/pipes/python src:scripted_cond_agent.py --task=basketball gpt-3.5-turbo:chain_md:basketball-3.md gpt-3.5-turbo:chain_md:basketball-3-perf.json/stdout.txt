To put the ball into the hoop, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper over the hoop  4. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put gripper above ball.
    Once the gripper is around the ball, move it over the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is not over the hoop, the robot should move gripper over hoop.
    When the gripper is positioned above the hoop, release the ball into the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is over the hoop, the robot should release the ball into the hoop.
