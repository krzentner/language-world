    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Pick up cube with gripper  4. Move the cube sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube, with the gripper slightly open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is slightly open
    Once the gripper is aligned, close it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    The cube should be gripping now and the robot can pick it up and move it sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
