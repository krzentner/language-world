Steps:  1. Put gripper above dial  2. Grab dial with gripper  3. Turn dial to unlock the door
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial
    If the dial becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the dial. Check if the gripper is lined up with the dial from the front instead of around it.
    - When the dial is not left of the robot's gripper and dial is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, grab the dial and turn it to unlock the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
