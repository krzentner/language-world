    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Close gripper around the stick  3. Move gripper so it is forward aligned with the thermos  4. Push thermos towards target location
    First, we need to put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    If the robot's gripper is above the stick, close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is closed and it is near the thermos, move the stick so it is forward aligned with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the stick is not forward aligned with the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is forward aligned with the thermos
    Finally, use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the target location
