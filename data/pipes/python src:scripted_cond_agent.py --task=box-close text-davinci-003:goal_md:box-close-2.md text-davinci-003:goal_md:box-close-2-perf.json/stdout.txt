    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Line the box lid up with the box  4. Lower the box lid onto the box
    The first step would be to put the gripper above the box lid. This should align the robot's gripper with the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    The next step would be to grab the box lid with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the box lid, we can line it up with the box by positioning the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the box lid is not lined up with the box, move the robot's gripper until the box lid is lined up with the box
    Once the box lid is lined up, we can lower the box lid onto the box.
    - When the box lid is lined up with the box and the robot's gripper is not near the box, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box
