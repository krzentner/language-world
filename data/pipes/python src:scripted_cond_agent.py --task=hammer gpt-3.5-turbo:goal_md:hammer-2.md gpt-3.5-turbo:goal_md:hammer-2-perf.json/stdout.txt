To hit the nail with the hammer, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hammer  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper  3. Line up the hammer with the nail  4. Swing the hammer down to hit the nail
    First, put the gripper above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer
    If the hammer becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the hammer.
    - When hammer is not left of the robot's gripper and the hammer is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the hammer and the hammer isn't lined up with the nail, line up the hammer with the nail.
    - When the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer
    If the hammer is lined up with the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hammer and the hammer is not horizontally aligned with the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail.
