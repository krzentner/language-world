Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck, close the gripper so that it picks up the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the target location. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to target location.


Steps:  1. Reach towards the puck  2. Put gripper around the puck  3. Close gripper around the puck  4. Reach towards the target location  5. Release the puck at the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should reach towards the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck, the robot should reach towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and near the target location, the robot should release the puck at the target location.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab puck with gripper  3. Move puck to target location
    First, put the gripper directly above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Once the robot's gripper is above the puck, close the gripper to grab it and then move to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    If the puck is below the gripper, we can move the gripper with the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to target location.
