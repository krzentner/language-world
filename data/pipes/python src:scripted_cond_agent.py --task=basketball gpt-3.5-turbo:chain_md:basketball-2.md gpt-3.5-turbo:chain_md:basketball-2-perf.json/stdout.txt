To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Move the ball towards the hoop  4. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put gripper above the ball.
    Once the gripper is around the ball, move it towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the ball, the robot should move the ball towards the hoop.
    Once the ball is near the hoop, release it gently into the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hoop, the robot should release the ball into the hoop.
