Steps:
1. Put gripper above the box lid
2. Drop gripper around the box lid
3. Close gripper around the box lid
4. Move the box lid to the box
5. Place the box lid on the box

If the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move it above the lid.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box lid")
```

If the gripper isn't around the lid, put it around the lid.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the box lid", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the lid and open, stop and close the gripper.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the box lid is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box")
```

If the box lid is in the robot's grip, move it near the box.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the box lid is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the box", close_gripper=False)
```

If the box lid is near the box, lower it onto the box.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box")
```
