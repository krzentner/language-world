    Steps:  1. Place the robot's gripper above the ball  2. Drop the robot's gripper around the ball  3. Close the robot's gripper around the ball  4. Move the robot's gripper towards the hoop  5. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, place the robot's gripper above the ball so we can trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball
    If the gripper isn't around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the ball, we can now move it towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is close to the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the hoop 
    When the gripper and the ball are in front of the hoop, release the ball and watch it fall into the hoop. 
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the hoop and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
