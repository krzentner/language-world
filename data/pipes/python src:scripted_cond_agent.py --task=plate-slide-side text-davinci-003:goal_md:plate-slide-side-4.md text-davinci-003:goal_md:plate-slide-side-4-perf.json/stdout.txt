    Steps:  1. Put gripper horizontally forward of the plate  2. Grasp the plate with the gripper  3. Move the plate to the target location
    To accurately move the plate, we should start by putting the gripper ahead of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the plate, we can grasp it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    Now that the robot has grasped the plate, it can be moved to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
