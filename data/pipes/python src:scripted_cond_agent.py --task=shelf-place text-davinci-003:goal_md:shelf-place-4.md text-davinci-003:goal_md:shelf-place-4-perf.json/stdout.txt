Steps:  1. Reach towards the block  2. Put gripper around the block  3. Close gripper around the block  4. Move block to the target location
    First, reach towards the block to make sure the robot's gripper is near the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block
    To grasp the block, put the robot's gripper around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is near the block and closed, move the block to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the block is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
