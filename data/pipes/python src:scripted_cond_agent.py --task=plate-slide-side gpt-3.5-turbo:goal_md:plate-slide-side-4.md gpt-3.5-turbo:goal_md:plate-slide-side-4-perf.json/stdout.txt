To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with gripper  3. Move plate to target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is not around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the plate, slide the plate sideways into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the target location and then move it sideways to slide the plate into the target location.
