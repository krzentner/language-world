    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Rearrange the stick with the gripper  3. Reposition the stick near the thermos  4. Pull the thermos with the stick
    If the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper to the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick
    
If the robot's gripper is near the stick, rearrange the stick so that it is in the best position for grabbing the thermos.
    - When the robot's stick is malpositioned, move the robot's gripper until the robot's stick is in the optimal position for grabbing the thermos

Next reposition the stick so that it is near the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos

Finally, pull the thermos with the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the robot's stick is not touching the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's stick is touching the thermos
