    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the peg  2. Drop the gripper around the peg  3. Move the wrench around the peg  4. Close the robot's gripper
    The robot needs to first put its gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    After the robot's gripper is above the peg, drop it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper is around the peg, move the wrench around the peg.
    - When the wrench is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the wrench is around the peg
    Once the wrench is around the peg, close the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the wrench is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
