    Steps:  1. Put gripper above faucet handle  2. Grab faucet handle with the gripper  3. Push the faucet handle to the right  4. Push the faucet handle harder
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, we should be able to grab the faucet handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can just push the handle to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle and the faucet handle is not to the right, move the robot's gripper until the faucet handle is to the right
    If the handle is starting to become difficult to turn, push harder.
    - When the faucet handle is to the right, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle
