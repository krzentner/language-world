To slide the plate back reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Approach the plate  2. Move the gripper under the plate  3. Lift the plate up  4. Move the plate back to the target location  5. Lower the plate onto the target location
    First, approach the plate to get closer to it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    Once the gripper is near the plate, move it under the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not under the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is under the plate
    Now that the gripper is under the plate, lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is under the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is not yet at the target location while the gripper is closed, move the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the plate is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper and the plate until the plate is above the target location
    Finally, lower the plate onto the target location.
    - When the plate is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and the plate is on the target location
