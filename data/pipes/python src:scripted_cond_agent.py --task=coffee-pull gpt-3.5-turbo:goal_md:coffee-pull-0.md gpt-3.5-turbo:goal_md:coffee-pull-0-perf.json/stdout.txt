To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle of the mug  2. Lift the mug off the table  3. Move the mug to the target location by pulling it towards the target location
    First, put the gripper around the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug and above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, lift the mug off the table.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle of the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the table and the mug is lifted off the table
    Move the mug to the target location by pulling it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the table and the mug is lifted off the table, move the robot's gripper until the mug is pulled towards the target location. The robot may need to partially open and close the gripper to ensure the mug does not slip. Once at the target location, place the mug down by opening the gripper.
