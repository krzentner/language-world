    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the handle   2. Lower the gripper onto the handle  3. Start to pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should place gripper above the handle.
    If the gripper is aligned with the handle, we can move it down onto it and start pulling.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not on the handle, the robot should lower gripper onto handle.
    If the gripper is on the handle, we are ready to start pulling it.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the handle, the robot should pull handle up.
