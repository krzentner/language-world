    Steps:  1. Reach above the wall 2. Reach around the wall  3. Reach towards the target location 
    First, reach up and above the wall with the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot is not above the wall, the robot should reach above the wall.
    Now that the gripper is above the wall, it's time for the robot to reach around the wall. Move the gripper away from the wall and then back towards it.
    - When the robot is not near the wall, the robot should reach around the wall.
    When the gripper is near the wall, the robot can now reach directly towards the target location.
    - When the robot is not near the target location and the robot is near the wall, the robot should reach towards the target location.
