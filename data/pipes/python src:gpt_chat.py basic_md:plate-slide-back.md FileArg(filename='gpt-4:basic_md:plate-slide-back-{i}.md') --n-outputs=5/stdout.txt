To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not against the edge of the target location, the robot should slide the plate back.
   - When the plate is against the edge of the target location, the robot should gently push the plate to its final position.
To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should push the gripper into the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate back to the target location by pushing it with the gripper while keeping the gripper closed.
To slide the plate back to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate back to the target location.
