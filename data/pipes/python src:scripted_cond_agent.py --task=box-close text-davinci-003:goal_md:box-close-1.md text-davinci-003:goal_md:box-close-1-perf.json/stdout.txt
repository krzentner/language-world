    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Lower the gripper onto the box lid  3. Close the gripper around the box lid  4. Move the robot and box lid together onto the box  5. Place the box lid on the box
    First, we need to put the gripper above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    If the gripper is not around the box lid, lower it onto the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is near the box lid and the gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the box lid, we can move the robot and box lid together onto the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the box lid is not on the box, move the robot's gripper until the box lid is on the box
