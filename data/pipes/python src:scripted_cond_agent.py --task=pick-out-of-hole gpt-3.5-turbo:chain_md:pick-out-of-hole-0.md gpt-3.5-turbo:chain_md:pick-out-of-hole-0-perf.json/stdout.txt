To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Move gripper down into the hole  3. Grab the peg with the gripper  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
    Move the gripper down into the hole to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole, the robot should move gripper down into the hole.
    Grab the peg with the gripper and make sure it has a firm grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside the hole, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper.
    Lift the peg out of the hole and check that the gripper maintains a strong grip on the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper has the peg and is not inside the hole, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
    Move the peg to the target location, making sure the gripper holds onto the peg securely.
    - When the gripper holds the peg securely and the peg is not at the target location, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
