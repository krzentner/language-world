    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Push the wrench downwards  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    The robot needs to put the gripper above the wrench and make sure it's lined up with the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the wrench, the robot should push it down. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with wrench and the wrench is not below gripper, the robot should push wrench downwards.
    Once the wrench is below the gripper, the robot should pull the wrench off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with wrench and the wrench is below the gripper, the robot should pull wrench off peg.
