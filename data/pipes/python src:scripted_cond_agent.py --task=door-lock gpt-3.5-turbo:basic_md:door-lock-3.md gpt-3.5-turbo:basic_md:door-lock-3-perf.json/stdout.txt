To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door lock and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial, the robot should position the gripper in front of the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the dial and not grasping it, the robot should close the gripper around the dial.
- When the gripper has the dial, the robot should turn the dial to the correct combination.
- When the dial is at the correct combination, the robot should release the dial and move the gripper away from the lock.
