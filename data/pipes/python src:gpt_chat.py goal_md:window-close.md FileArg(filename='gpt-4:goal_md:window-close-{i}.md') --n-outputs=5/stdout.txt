Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:

1. Put the gripper to the left of the window handle. 
2. If the gripper is not near the window handle, move the gripper near it until the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle. 
3. If the gripper is near the window handle, move the gripper so that the gripper is forward aligned with the window handle. 
4. If the window handle is right of the gripper and the gripper is not near the window handle, move the gripper until it is near the handle. 
5. Once the gripper is near the handle, push against the handle to close the window. 
6. If the window is not fully closed yet, push harder until the window is completely closed.
Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper left of the window handle
           2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
           3. Push the window closed harder
           If the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
           - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
           If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
           - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
           If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
           - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle.
Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:
1. Put the gripper left of the window handle.
2. If the window handle is not near the gripper, move the gripper near the window handle.
3. When the gripper is near the window handle, move the gripper until it is forward aligned with the window handle.
4. If the window handle is still to the left of the gripper, move the gripper almost vertically aligned with the window handle.
5. Push harder to close the window.
6. When the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle, move the gripper until it is forward aligned with the window handle.
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here are the correct steps for sliding the window closed to the right:
 
The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, we can begin pushing the window closed by moving the gripper to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle

    If the robot's gripper is starting to be behind the window handle, push harder.
