To reliably push down the handle from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around handle and the handle is not on the side of the gripper, the robot should move the handle to the side.
- When the handle is on the side of the gripper and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on the handle.
