To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should lift the puck off the surface.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed, the robot should lower the puck down to the target location and release it from the gripper.
To pick up the puck and move it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is holding the puck, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
To pick up the puck and move it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the puck, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should lift the puck off the ground.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move the puck to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the puck by opening the gripper.

- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pick up the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, the robot should move its arm to reach the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should place the puck at the target location by opening the gripper.

- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should lift the puck.
- When the robot is holding the puck, the robot should move towards the target location.
- When the robot is close to the target location and the gripper is closed, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
