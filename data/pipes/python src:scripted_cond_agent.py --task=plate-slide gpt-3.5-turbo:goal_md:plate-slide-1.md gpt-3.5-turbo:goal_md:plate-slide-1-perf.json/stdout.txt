To slide the plate into the target location the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate   2. Push the plate towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate, move it closer.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate, we can slide it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in the target location
