The steps to complete this task are as follows:

1. Put the gripper above the mug.
2. Grab the mug with the gripper.
3. Move the mug to the target location.

Therefore, the program will look like this:

```
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above mug
    #  2. Grab mug with gripper
    #  3. Move mug to target location
    # Put the gripper above the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug")
    # Grab the mug with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("mug")
    # Move the mug to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("mug to target location")
