To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around handle  2. Grip handle  3. Pull handle up from the side
    We need to put the gripper around the handle before we can lift it up. Move the gripper to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open
    Once the gripper is near the handle and open, position the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is not in the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the handle is in the gripper, we can lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is off to the side of the handle enough to lift it up keeping the gripper stable
