    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper around the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
