    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball  3. Slide soccer ball to goal
    The robot should first position the gripper such that the gripper is above the soccer ball, as seen from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper is in the correct position above the soccer ball, the robot can then push down on the soccer ball, trapping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Moving the gripper will then slide the soccer ball to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Center the robot's gripper above the soccer ball  2. Push the robot's gripper into the soccer ball to trap it and hold it in place  3. Push the soccer ball in the direction of the goal
    First, the robot should position its gripper above, and centred on, the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not centred above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is centred above the soccer ball
    Next, the robot should push the gripper into the soccer ball to trap it, and then hold the soccer ball in fixed position.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in contact with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, the soccer ball should be pushed in the direction of the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is in contact with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push gripper down onto ball  3. Push soccer ball to goal 
    First, we need to put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper is high enough above the soccer ball, close it to grab the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is closed, we can push the soccer ball towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push into the top of soccer ball  3. Slide soccer ball towards target location
    We need to move the gripper over the soccer ball before pushing it, so that we can accurately position it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    Once the gripper is above the soccer ball, we should push the gripper into the top of the soccer ball to get control of it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up with the soccer ball, we can slide it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near target location and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the soccer ball  2. Push the soccer ball forward  3. Retarget the robot's gripper
    First, put the gripper underneath the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not underneath the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is underneath the soccer ball
    If the gripper is underneath the soccer ball and still open, hold the soccer ball to minimize movement.
    - When the robot's gripper is underneath soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the soccer ball 
    We should be able to push the soccer ball forward once it's lined up with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is after the soccer ball is moved to the target location
    When the soccer ball is close to the target, it's important to reset the gripper position quickly so you can move the ball closer.
    - When the soccer ball is close to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is after the soccer ball is moved to the target location
