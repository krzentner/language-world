The program should be as follows: 

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above button
    #  2. Align gripper line up with the wall
    #  3. Push gripper through the opening in the wall to press the button
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Try to line up the gripper with the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not lined up with the wall"):
        robot.align("gripper with the wall")
    # If the gripper is lined up with the wall, then try to push it through the
    # opening in the wall to press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is lined up with the wall"):
        robot.push("gripper through the wall opening")
```
