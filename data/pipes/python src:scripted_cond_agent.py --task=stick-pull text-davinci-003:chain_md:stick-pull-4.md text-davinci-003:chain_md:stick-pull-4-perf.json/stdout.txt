    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the stick  2. Line up the stick with the thermos  3. Push the stick towards the thermos until the thermos is slightly touching the stick  4. Pull the thermos by the stick
    First, put the gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick, the robot should grab stick.
    Then line up the stick with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is not horizontally aligned with Thermos, the robot should align stick with Thermos.
    Once the stick is lined up with the Thermos, push the stick towards the Thermos until the Thermos is touching the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is horizontally aligned with Thermos and the Thermos is not touching stick, the robot should push stick towards Thermos.
    Finally, pull the Thermos by the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is horizontally aligned with Thermos and the Thermos is touching stick, the robot should pull Thermos with stick.
