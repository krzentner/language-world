    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move the cube sideways
    We need to put the gripper roughly above the cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the target location
    Now that the cube is secured, we can move it sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
