    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push the puck against wall away from goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the wall is right of the robot's gripper, the robot should push wall away from goal.
