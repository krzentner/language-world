Solution:

# peg-unplug-side: pull the peg out from the side
# def peg_unplug_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper right of the peg
    #  2. Grab peg with gripper
    #  3. Pull peg out sideways
    # 
    # First, put the gripper near the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the peg")
    # If the peg is left of the gripper, grab the peg with the gripper.
    if check("the peg is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # If the peg is right of the gripper, bring the gripper down so that it's
    # almost touching the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost touching the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # As long as the gripper is still mostly around the peg, pull the peg sideways
    # to slide it out of the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the hole")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper in front of the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg using the gripper
    #  3. Pull the peg out sideways
    # The first step is to put the gripper so that it's in front of the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # Grab the peg with the gripper by moving towards it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
    # With the peg in the gripper, pull it out sideways.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the peg")


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line the peg up with the hole
4. Slide the peg sideways out of the hole

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the gripper above the peg.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
```

If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
```
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
```

As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with hole")
```

If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, pull the peg out.
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the peg")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the peg
  2. Grab the peg with the gripper 
  3. Line the peg up with the hole
  4. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, we should move the gripper above the peg.

if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)

Once the gripper is lined up above the peg, we should be able to grab the peg by moving the gripper down around it.

if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the peg")

Once the gripper is around the peg, we need to line it up with the hole.

if check("the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole and the robot's gripper is around peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with hole")

Finally, once the peg is lined up with the hole, we can just pull the peg out by i.e. moving the gripper away from the hole.

if check("the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
    robot.move_gripper("away from the hole")


Then, fill in the Steps section with code:

```
# peg-unplug-side: pull the peg out from the side
# def peg_unplug_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper forward aligned with the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Pull the peg sideways
    # First, put the gripper forward aligned with the peg.
    if check("the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)  
    # Now that the gripper is lined up with the peg, just grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
    # Once the gripper is grabing the peg, we can pull the peg sideways.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the hole")     
```
