Steps:
1. Put gripper above mug
2. Drop gripper around mug
3. Close gripper around mug
4. Move mug to goal

First, put the gripper roughly above the mug, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the mug")

If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.

if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the mug", close_gripper=True)

If the gripper is near the mug and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.

if check("the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
