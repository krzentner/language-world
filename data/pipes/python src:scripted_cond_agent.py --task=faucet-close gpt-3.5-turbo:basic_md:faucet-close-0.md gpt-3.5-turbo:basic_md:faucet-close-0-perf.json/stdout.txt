To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper closer to the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the handle is turned on, the robot should turn the handle to the right.
- When the handle is fully turned to the right, the robot should stop turning the handle.
