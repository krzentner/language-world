    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of door handle  2. Push against the door handle to close the door  3. Push the door closers harder  4. Move the door handle to the target location
    If the robot's gripper is not in front of the door handle, push against door handle to close the door. Do this by moving the robot's gripper until it's in front of the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle and the door isn't closed all the way, push harder.
    - When the door is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    Once the door is closed, move the door handle to the target location.
    - When the door handle is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the door handle is near the target location
