To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper closer to the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should slide the plate sideways towards the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the target location sideways while keeping the gripper in contact with the plate.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should place the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not between the gripper and the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the plate closest to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is between the gripper and the target location, the robot should push the plate sideways toward the target location.
- When the plate has been pushed to the target location, the robot should release the grip on the plate.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not beside the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should align the gripper beside the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is beside the plate and the gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location and the gripper is not beside the target location, the robot should slide the plate sideways into the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the plate is not aligned with the gripper, the robot should move gripper to one side of the plate.
- When the gripper is above the plate and open, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
- When the gripper is closed around the plate, the robot should move the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate is near the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
