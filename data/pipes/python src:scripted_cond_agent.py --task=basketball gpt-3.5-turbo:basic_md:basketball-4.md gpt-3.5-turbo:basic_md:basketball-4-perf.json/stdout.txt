To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and open, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball and the hoop is in front of the robot, the robot should move towards the hoop.
- When the robot is close enough to the hoop and the hoop is vertically aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should throw the ball towards the hoop, aiming for the center of the hoop. 
- After the ball has been thrown, the robot should release the gripper and return to its starting position.
