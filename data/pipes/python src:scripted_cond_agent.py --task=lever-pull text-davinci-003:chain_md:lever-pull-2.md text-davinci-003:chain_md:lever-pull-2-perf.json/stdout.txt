    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Grab lever with gripper  3. Pull up on the lever
    First, put grasper above the lever so that the robot can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    If the lever isn't left of the gripper, move the gripper left to start to grab the lever.
    - When the lever is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, the robot should put gripper around lever.
    Once we have the gripper around the lever, pull up on the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, the robot should pull up on lever.
