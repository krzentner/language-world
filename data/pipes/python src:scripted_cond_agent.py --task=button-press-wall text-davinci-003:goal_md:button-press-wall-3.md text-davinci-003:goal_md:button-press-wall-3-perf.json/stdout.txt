    Steps:  1. Put gripper near short wall and forward aligned with button  2. Push button from the front with short wall in the way
    The robot needs to put the gripper as close to the short wall as possible.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is near short wall
    If our gripper is near the short wall, we should be able to press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the short wall and forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
