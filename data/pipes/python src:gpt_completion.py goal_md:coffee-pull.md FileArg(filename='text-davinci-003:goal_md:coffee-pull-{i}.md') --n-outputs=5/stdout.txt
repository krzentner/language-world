1. Put gripper first above, then around the mug handle
2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper
3. Start pulling the mug towards target
4. Keep the mug steady when moving
    
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
- When the mug is near the target, decrease the speed of the robot's movement to keep the mug steady

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Drop gripper around the mug  3. Close gripper around the mug  4. Pull the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the gripper is closed around the mug we can start pulling it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper directly above mug  2. Drop gripper closed around mug  3. Pull the mug to the target location
    We need to put the gripper above the mug before we can grab it, so that we don't knock it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is directly above the mug
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, drop it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the mug, we can probably grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the targetlocation

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near handle of mug  2. Close gripper around mug handle  3. Pull the mug towards target location
    First, put the gripper near the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle
    If the gripper is near the mug handle and not around it, capture the mug handle by moving the gripper around it and closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug handle is securely in the robot's grip, pull the mug towards the target location.
    - When the mug handle is securely gripped, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the mug  2. Pull the mug towards the goal  3. Control the mug's rotation and lift
    First, we need to put the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug
    We can start to pull the mug towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    At this point, we need to control the rotation and lift of the mug, so it doesn't slide out of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the mug is not facing the target location, rotate the robot's gripper until the mug is facing the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the mug is not at the desired height, lift the robot's gripper until the mug is at the desired height
