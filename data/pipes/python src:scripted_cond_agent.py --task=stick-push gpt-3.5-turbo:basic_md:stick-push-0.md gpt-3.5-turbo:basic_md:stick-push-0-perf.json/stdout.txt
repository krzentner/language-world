To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick or the thermos, the robot should move to a position where it can grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not holding the stick and the stick is nearby, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the robot's gripper is not above the thermos and not vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick to a position above the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the thermos and the stick is not touching the thermos, the robot should push the stick against the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is touching the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
