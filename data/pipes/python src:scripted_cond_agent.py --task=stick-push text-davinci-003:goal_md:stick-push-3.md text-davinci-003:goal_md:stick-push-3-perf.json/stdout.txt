    Steps:  1. Line up the stick with the edge of the thermos  2. Push the stick along the edge of the thermos  3. Push the thermos to the target location
    First, line up the stick with the edge of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not left of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the left edge of the thermos
    Once the stick is lined up, it should be ready to push the thermos.
    - When the stick is forward aligned with thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Now, we can use the stick to push the thermos by slowly moving it along the edge.
    - When the stick is left of the robot's grip and the thermos is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the thermos is near the target location
