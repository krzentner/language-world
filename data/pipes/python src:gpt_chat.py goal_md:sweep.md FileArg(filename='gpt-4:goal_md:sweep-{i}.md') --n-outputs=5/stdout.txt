The task `sweep` requires the robot to grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location.
To grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab cube with the gripper  3. Move gripper and cube towards the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and closed, we can grab it and move it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, move the robot's gripper and cube sideways towards the target location.
The task `sweep` requires the robot to grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location.
To grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube
    To start, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the gripper is above the cube, drop the gripper around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the cube, we can now slide the cube to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper horizontally to the target location while keeping the cube gripped.
To perform the task `sweep`, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the cube  2. Close the gripper around the cube  3. Move the gripper sideways to the goal

First, put the robot's gripper above the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
Once the gripper is above the cube, close the gripper around the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is near the cube and the gripper is closed
Now that the gripper is holding the cube, move it sideways to the goal. 
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, move the robot's gripper until it's near the goal and then move the gripper sideways to reach the goal location.
To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Open gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Lift the cube up slightly  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Lower the cube onto the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Open the gripper around the cube to grip it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube
    Close the gripper around the cube to hold it securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, close the gripper around the cube
    Lift the cube up slightly to clear the surface.
    - When the gripper is closed around the cube, lift the cube up slightly
    Move the gripper to the target location while keeping a firm grip on the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and is not near to the target location, move the robot's gripper to the target location
    Lower the cube onto the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, lower the cube onto the target location
To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move the cube sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube, so we don't bump into it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and closed, we can pick it up and move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper sideways until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
