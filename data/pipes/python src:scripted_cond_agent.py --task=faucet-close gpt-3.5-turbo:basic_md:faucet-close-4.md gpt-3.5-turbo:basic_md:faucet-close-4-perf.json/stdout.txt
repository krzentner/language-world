To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper to the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, the robot should grab the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle towards the right direction.
- When the faucet is fully closed, the robot should release the handle.
