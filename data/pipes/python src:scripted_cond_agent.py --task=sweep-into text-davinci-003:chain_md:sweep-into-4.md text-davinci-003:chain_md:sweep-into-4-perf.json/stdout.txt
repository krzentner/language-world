Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Grab the cube with gripper  3. Slide the cube to the target location
    First, move the gripper towards the cube. 
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, the robot should reach towards the cube.
    When the robot's gripper is near the cube, close the gripper to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the cube.
    If the grip is closed and we've successfully grabbed the cube, slide it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide the cube to the target location.
