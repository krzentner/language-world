Steps:
1. Put gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around the mug handle
3. Pull mug to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, we should move the gripper above the mug handle.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the mug handle")
```

If the robot's gripper is above the mug handle but not around it, we should move the gripper around the mug handle.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the mug handle")
```

Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can pull the mug to the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the mug handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
