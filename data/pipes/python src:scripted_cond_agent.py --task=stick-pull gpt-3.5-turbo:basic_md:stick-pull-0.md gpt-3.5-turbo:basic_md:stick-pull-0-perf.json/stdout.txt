To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick close to the thermos.
- When the end of the stick is not above the thermos and the stick is not vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick above the thermos.
- When the end of the stick is vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should lower the end of the stick until it touches the top of the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the thermos and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should use the gripper to grab the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the thermos, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location.
- When the robot arrives at the target location, the robot should release the thermos by opening the gripper.
