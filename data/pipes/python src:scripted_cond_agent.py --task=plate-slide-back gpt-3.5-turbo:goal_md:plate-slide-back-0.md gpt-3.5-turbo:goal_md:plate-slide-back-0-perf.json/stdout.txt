To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper into top of plate to trap it  3. Slide plate back to target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Start sliding the gripper down on top of the plate to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not touching the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the plate
    Once the gripper is on top of the plate, we can slide it back to the target location. If the plate isn't aligned with the gripper, move the gripper to align it.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the plate and the plate is not aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is aligned with the target location
    If the gripper is near the target location now, we can slide the plate into place.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open.
