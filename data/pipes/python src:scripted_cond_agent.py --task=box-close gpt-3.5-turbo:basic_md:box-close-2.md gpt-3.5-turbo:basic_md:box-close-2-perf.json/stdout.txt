To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the box lid is not completely open, the robot should use the gripper to completely open the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is open and near the box lid, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should move the gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is not aligned with the box, the robot should align the box lid with the box.
- When the box lid is aligned with the box, the robot should lower the gripper so that the box lid rests on the box.
