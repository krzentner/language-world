The robot should perform the following steps: 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move gripper above cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not surrounding cube, the robot should lower gripper onto cube.
- When the robot's gripper is surrounding cube and the robot's gripper is not near the goal, the robot should slide cube to the goal.


- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the gripper is not around cube, the robot should extend gripper around cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near cube, the robot should move laterally in the direction of the target location and sweep the cube.

    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
