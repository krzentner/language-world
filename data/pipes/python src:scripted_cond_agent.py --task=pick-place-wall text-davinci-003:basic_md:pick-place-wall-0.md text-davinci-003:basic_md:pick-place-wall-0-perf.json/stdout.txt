    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall is in the way, the robot should move its gripper to the side of the puck in order to be able to reach the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the wall is still in the way, the robot should reach around the wall and place its gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the wall is still in the way, the robot should close its gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck, the robot should move to the target location and place the puck there.
