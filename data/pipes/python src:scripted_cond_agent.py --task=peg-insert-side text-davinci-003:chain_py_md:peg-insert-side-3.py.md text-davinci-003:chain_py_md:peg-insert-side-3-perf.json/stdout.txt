The code should be as follows:

```
# peg-insert-side: insert the peg into the hole from the side
# def peg_insert_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.align("peg to hole")
    # If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.insert("peg into hole")
```
