To push the thermos to the target location using the stick reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the stick behind the thermos and align it with the center.
    - When the stick is not behind the thermos, move the stick towards the thermos.
    - When the stick is not aligned with the center of the thermos, rotate it until it is aligned.
    
2. Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
    - When the thermos is not near the target location, move the stick with the thermos towards the target location.
The robot can use the stick to push the thermos to the target location. The following steps can be performed by the robot to complete the task `stick-push`:

Steps:
1. Put the gripper near the stick's handle
2. Open the gripper and attach it to the stick's handle
3. Move the robot's gripper to the thermos
4. Position the stick's end to touch the thermos's side
5. Push the thermos to the target location with the stick
6. Once the thermos is at the target location, detach the gripper from the stick's handle and move the gripper away

If the gripper is not near the stick's handle, move it near. Then the gripper needs to be attached to the stick's handle by opening it and grasping the handle. Once the gripper is attached to the stick, the robot should move the gripper to the thermos. The next step is to position the stick's end to touch the thermos's side. Using the stick's end, the robot can slide the thermos to the target location. Once the thermos is at the target location, the robot should detach the gripper from the stick's handle and move the gripper away.
To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the stick behind the thermos  2. Push the stick forward to push the thermos to the target location
    First, position the stick behind the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos but not touching it
    To push the thermos using the stick, move the stick forward.
    - When the stick is positioned behind the thermos and the robot's gripper is near the thermos but not touching it, move the stick forward to push the thermos to the target location.
To push the thermos to the target location using the stick, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the stick
        2. Grab the stick with the gripper
        3. Position the gripper with the stick above the thermos
        4. Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick

First, put the gripper above the stick by aligning to the stick's position.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
Grab the stick by closing the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the gripper is not closed, close the gripper around the stick
Position the gripper with the stick above the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is not above the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is approximately  above the thermos
Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick by moving the gripper with the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the thermos is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper and the stick until the thermos is pushed towards the target location
To push the thermos to the target location with a stick, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the stick next to the thermos  2. Push the thermos with the stick towards the goal location
    First, position the stick next to the thermos so that it can be used to push the thermos towards the target.
    - When the stick is not next to the thermos, move the stick until it is next to the thermos
    Once the stick is positioned, use it to push the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the thermos is not at the target location, push the thermos towards the target location using the stick until it reaches the target.
