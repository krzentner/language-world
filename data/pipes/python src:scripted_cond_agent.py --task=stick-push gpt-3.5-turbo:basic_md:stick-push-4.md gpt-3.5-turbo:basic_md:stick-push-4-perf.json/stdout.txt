To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not holding the stick and the stick is not near the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick but the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick near the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is near the thermos but not touching it, the robot should position the stick to push the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is positioned to push the thermos, the robot should push the thermos to the target location using the stick.
