    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wall 2. Line up the gripper as viewed from the side  3. Lower the gripper to push the button 
    First, put the gripper above the wall since this will prevent the robot's gripper from running into the wall while trying to grab the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should place gripper above the wall.
    Next, line up the gripper so that it can be seen from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not side aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is above the wall but not forward aligned with the button, the robot should line up gripper as viewed from the side.
    If the gripper is forward aligned but not close enough to the button, lower the gripper to push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not close enough to button, the robot should lower gripper to push button.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the short wall 2. Move gripper left to the button 3. Push the button
    First, we need to put the gripper in front of the short wall. This is so that the short wall can provide structural support while pushing the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of short wall, the robot should put gripper in front of short wall.
    If the robot's gripper is near the button, we can start to push the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is near button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, the robot should move gripper left to the button.
    Once the robot's gripper is touching the button, just push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should push the button.

Steps: 
    1. Put gripper right of the button and over the wall 
    2. Push the button from the front 
    3. Push the button harder.

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper right of the button and over the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the button and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should move the gripper right of the button and over the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should push the button from the front.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is in front of the button, the robot should push the button harder.

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper just below the wall  2. Push the button from the front
    Since there is a wall blocking the way, the robot should put the gripper just below the wall before pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not underneath the wall, the robot should put gripper just below wall.
    Now that the gripper is underneath the wall, we can try pushing the button.
    - When robot's gripper is underneath the wall, the robot should push button from the front.

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the button  2. Lift the wall with the gripper  3. Push down on the button from the front
    We need to move the gripper above the button so that we can grab the wall and lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
    Now that the gripper is above the button, we can grab the wall by closing the gripper and lifting it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is not lifted from its bottom, the robot should lift wall from its bottom.
    Now that the wall is lifted, we can push down on the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is lifted, the robot should push down on button.
