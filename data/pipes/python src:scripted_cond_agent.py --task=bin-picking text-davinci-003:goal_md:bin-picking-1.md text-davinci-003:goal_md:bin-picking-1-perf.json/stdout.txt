    Steps:  1. Reach for the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Reach for the target bin  4. Place the cube in the target bin.
    The first step is to reach for the cube. We can do this by moving the robot's gripper directly to the cube, if the target is visible. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube
    Once the robot's gripper is near the cube, the robot can grab the cube by closing the gripper
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, we can start to move toward the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin
    Once the robot's gripper is near the target bin, the robot can place the cube inside by opening the gripper and then releasing it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the bin
