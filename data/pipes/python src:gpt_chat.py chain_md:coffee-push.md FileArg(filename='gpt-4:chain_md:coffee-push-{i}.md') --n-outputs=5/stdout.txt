Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
The task `coffee-push` can be divided into two sub-tasks: `grab` and `move`
 
For the `grab` sub-task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above mug  2. Grab the handle of the mug  3. Lift the mug up
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, the robot should put gripper above mug.
    If the gripper is already above the mug, try to grab the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should grab mug handle.
    If the gripper successfully grabs the handle of the mug, lift the mug up.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug handle, the robot should lift the mug up.
    
For the `move` sub-task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Move to the target location  2. Release the mug
    Move the gripper and mug to the target location while keeping the mug above the surface.
    - When the mug is not above target location, the robot should move to the target location while holding the mug.
    When the target location is reached, release the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should release the mug.
Here are the steps the robot should perform for the `coffee-push` task:
Steps: 1. Put gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around the mug handle
3. Close gripper around the mug handle
4. Lift up the mug
5. Move gripper to the target location
6. Lower the mug on the target location
7. Open the gripper to release the mug

First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle to avoid hitting the mug while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should place the gripper above the mug handle.
Next, move the gripper around the mug handle and close the gripper to firmly grab the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and open, the robot should drop gripper around the mug handle and close the gripper.
Now that the robot has a firm hold of the mug, lift it up to move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug handle, the robot should lift the mug up.
Move the gripper and the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should move to the target location while holding the mug.
Once the robot has reached the target location, lower the mug onto it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the mug onto it.
Finally, open the gripper to release the mug.
- When the mug is successfully placed on the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the mug.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Close gripper around mug handle  4. Move mug to goal
First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should place gripper above the mug handle.
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the mug handle.
If the gripper is near the mug handle and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug handle.
We closed the gripper, and the mug is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the mug to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the mug to the goal location.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle of the mug. 2. Drop gripper around the handle of the mug. 3. Close gripper around the handle of the mug. 4. Lift up the mug. 5. Move the mug to the target location. 6. Put the mug down.

First, the robot should put its gripper above the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the handle of the mug, the robot should place its gripper above the handle of the mug.

Next, the robot should drop its gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should drop its gripper around the handle of the mug.

Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle of the mug.

After the robot has a good grip on the mug, it should lift it up.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle of the mug, the robot should lift up the mug.

The robot should then move the mug to the target location.
- When the robot has lifted up the mug, the robot should move it to the target location.

Finally, the robot should put the mug down at the target location.
- When the robot has moved the mug to the target location, the robot should put the mug down.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Drop gripper around the mug handle and lift the mug  3. Move the gripper to the target location  4. Lower the mug to the target location and release the gripper
First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should put the gripper above the mug handle.
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the handle and lift the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the mug handle and lift the mug.
Move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and is not above the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
Lower the mug to the target location and release the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and holding the mug, the robot should lower the mug to the target location and release the gripper.
