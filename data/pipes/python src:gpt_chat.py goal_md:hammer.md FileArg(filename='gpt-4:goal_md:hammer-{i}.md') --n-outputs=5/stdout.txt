To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above hammer handle  2. Grab the hammer  3. Position the hammer above the nail  4. Swing the hammer to hit the nail
    First, put the gripper above the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, we need to grab the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we have the hammer, position it above the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is above the nail
    Finally, swing the hammer to hit the nail.
    - When the hammer is above the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hammer handle  2. Drop gripper around the hammer handle  3. Line up the hammer with the nail  4. Apply downward force to hit the nail with the hammer
    First, put the gripper above the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer handle
    Next, grab the hammer by dropping the gripper around the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is holding the hammer, line up the hammer with the nail.
    - When the hammer is not lined up with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is lined up with the nail
    As long as the hammer is above the nail, apply downward force to hit the nail with the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail, apply downward force to hit the nail with the hammer.

    First, put the gripper above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer
    If the hammer becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the hammer.
    - When hammer is not left of the robot's gripper and the hammer is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the hammer and the hammer isn't lined up with the nail, line up the hammer with the nail.
    - When the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer
    If the hammer is lined up with the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hammer and the hammer is not horizontally aligned with the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail.

    Once the gripper is above the hammer and gripper is closed, line the hammer up with the nail.
    - When the hammer is not horizontally aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail
    Now that the hammer is lined up with the nail, we can hit the nail.
    - When the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is lowered down onto the nail and then lifted up again
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Pick up hammer by handle  2. Put hammer over the nail head with a good amount of clearance  3. Move hammer downward and hit the nail
    First, position the gripper around the handle of the hammer and pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the hammer and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle of the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, position the hammer over the nail head with enough clearance to swing and hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail with a good amount of clearance, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the nail with a good amount of clearance
    Finally, move the hammer downward and hit the nail.
    - Move the robot's gripper downward until the hammer hits the nail
