To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the stick is not in front of the thermos and the robot's gripper is not holding the stick, the robot should place the stick in front of the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, the robot should drop the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
- When the stick is near the thermos and the thermos is not near the target location, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
