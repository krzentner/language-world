This code first checks if the gripper is above the puck, and proceeds to drop the gripper around it if it is not already around it and the gripper is open. The gripper is then closed, and if the gripper is above the puck and closed, the robot checks if the path to the target location is blocked by the wall. If it is, the robot moves to the side of the wall, moves towards the target location, and then moves back to the center. Finally, the robot places the puck at the goal location.
