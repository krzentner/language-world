    Steps:  1. Move gripper above block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Lift block up  5. Move block to target location  6. Lower block until it touches target location
    We need to put the gripper above the block before we can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the the target location
    Once the block is near the target, lift it up and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the block is just above the target location and then lower the block until it is touching the target location.
