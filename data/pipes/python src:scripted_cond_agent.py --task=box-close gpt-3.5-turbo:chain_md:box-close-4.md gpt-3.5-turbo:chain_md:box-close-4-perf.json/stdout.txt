To pick up the box lid and place it on the box, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Move gripper above the box  4. Release the box lid to place it on the box
    First, put the gripper above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid, the robot should put gripper above the box lid.
    Once the gripper is around the box lid, move the gripper above the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, the robot should move gripper above the box.
    Once the gripper is above the box, open the gripper to release the box lid and place it on top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is closed around the box lid, the robot should release the box lid to place it on top of the box.
