This program should do the following: 

1. Put gripper to the left of the peg 
2. Grab the wrench and move it so that itâ€™s aligned with the peg
3. Drop the wrench on the peg 
4. Close the gripper to grasp the wrench and peg 
5. Move the wrench around the peg 

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper to the left of the peg
    #  2. Grab the wrench and move it so that it's aligned with the peg
    #  3. Drop the wrench on the peg
    #  4. Close the gripper to grasp the wrench and peg
    #  5. Move the wrench around the peg
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the left of the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper to the left of the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the left of the peg and the wrench is not forward aligned with the peg"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
        robot.align("wrench with peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the left of the peg and the wrench is forward aligned with the peg and the wrench is not on the peg"):
        robot.drop("wrench onto the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the left of the peg and the wrench is forward aligned with the peg and the wrench is above the peg"):
        robot.close("gripper around wrench and peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the left of the peg and the wrench is forward aligned with the peg and the wrench is below the peg"):
        robot.move("wrench around the peg")
```


Then, continue with the following steps:

1. Put gripper above wrench
2. Grab wrench with gripper
3. Put gripper around peg
4. Put wrench around peg
5. Push peg and wrench together

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench
    #  2. Grab wrench with gripper
    #  3. Put gripper around peg
    #  4. Put wrench around peg
    #  5. Push peg and wrench together
    # First, move the gripper so that it is above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    # Now, if the wrench is left of the robot's gripper, grab it.
    if check("wrench is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    # If the robot's gripper and the wrench are aligned, move the grip to around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper around peg")
    # Now that the gripper is around the peg, line the wrench up with it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench to peg")
    # Finally, push the peg and wrench together.
    if check("the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.push("peg and wrench together")
```


The program for the `assembly` task would look like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the wrench
    #  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    #  3. Put the wrench around the peg
    #  4. Move the wrench around the peg
    # First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    # If the wrench becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the wrench.
    # Because the wrench is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with
    # it from the front instead of around it.
    if check("wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and wrench is not aligned with the robot's gripper forward"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the wrench and the wrench isn't
    # lined up with the peg, line up the wrench with the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the wrench forward and the wrench is not in line with the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench to peg")
    # If the peg is lined up with the wrench from the side, move the wrench
    # around the peg.
    if check("wrench is in line with the peg"):
        robot.move("wrench around peg")
```


Here's the program:
```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench
    #  2. Grab wrench with gripper
    #  3. Line up wrench with peg
    #  4. Drop wrench around peg
    # First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    # Once the gripper is above the wrench, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    # Align wrench with peg
    if check("the robot's gripper is above peg and wrench is not horizontally aligned with peg"):
        robot.align("wrench to peg")
    # Drop wrench around peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("wrench around peg")
```


Then your code should look something like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper above the wrench handle
    # 2. Drop the gripper around the wrench handle
    # 3. Line up the wrench with the peg, as seen from above
    # 4. Close the gripper around the handle of the wrench
    # 5. Place the wrench around the peg

    # First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench handle")

    # Once the gripper is lined up above the wrench handle, we can drop it around
    # the handle so that we can gain control of the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench handle")
    
    # When the gripper is around the wrench handle and the gripper is closed, we 
    # can line up the wrench with the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.align("wrench with peg, as seen from above")

    # Once the wrench is lined up with the peg, close the gripper so we can keep
    # control of it.
    if check("the wrench is vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle of wrench")

    # Finally, we can place the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the wrench is aligned with the peg"):
        robot.place("wrench around peg")
```
