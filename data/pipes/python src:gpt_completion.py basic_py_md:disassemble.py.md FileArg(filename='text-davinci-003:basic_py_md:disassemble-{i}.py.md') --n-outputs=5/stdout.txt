Here's the code that needs to be written:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around it"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench"):
        robot.pull("the wrench away from the peg")
```


Answer:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.place("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench"):
        robot.pull("wrench off peg")
```


Solution:
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not above the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench with the peg")
    if check("the wrench is above the peg"):
        robot.pull("wrench off the peg")


If check("the robot's gripper is not near the peg and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move("gripper above the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.drop("the gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.pull("the wrench away from the peg")


Solution

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the wrench is not slightly away from the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the wrench is slightly away from the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("wrench away from peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not empty"):
        robot.open("gripper to release wrench")
