To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper near the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out to the side
First, put the gripper near the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg
If the gripper is not already around the peg, grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull it out.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper to the side until the peg is released from its socket.
