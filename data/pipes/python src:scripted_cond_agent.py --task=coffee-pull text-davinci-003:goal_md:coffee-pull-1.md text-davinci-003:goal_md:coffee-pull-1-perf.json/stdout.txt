    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Drop gripper around the mug  3. Close gripper around the mug  4. Pull the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the gripper is closed around the mug we can start pulling it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
