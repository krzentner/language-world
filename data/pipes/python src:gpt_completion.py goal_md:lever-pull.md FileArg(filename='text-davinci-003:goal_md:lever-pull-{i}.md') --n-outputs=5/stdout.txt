    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Pull lever up
    As with all of these tasks, we always want to start by getting our gripper in the right location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
    If the gripper is above the lever, grab it by pushing the gripper down against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we have the lever, just pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the lever has rotated to the desired orientation

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Grab lever with gripper  3. Rotate lever up
    We need to ensure that the gripper is lined up with the lever above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just grab the lever by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    We need to be extra careful that the gripper is not directly over the lever, so close the gripper to ensure that it's actually gripping.
    - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is opposing the lever
    If the gripper is opposing the lever, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is opposing the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is rotated to the fully-up position

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the lever handle  2. Grab the lever handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the lever up
    First, the robot should move the gripper near the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever handle
    If the grip is close enough to the handle that the grip might be able to grab it, grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near lever handle and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the grip is closed around the handle, we can rotate the lever up.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is rotated up

   Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the bottom of the lever  2. Push up on the lever as high as possible  3. Move the gripper around lever to get better purchase  4. Pull up on lever to rotate it up
   We need to line up the gripper with the bottom of the lever so that it can get some purchase.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever's bottom, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever's bottom
   If the gripper is lined up with the lever, we can now push up on the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever's bottom, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever 
   If the gripper is still vertically aligned with the lever's bottom, move the gripper around the lever to get better purchase.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever
   If the gripper is around the lever, we can pull up on it to rotate it.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever


Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever  2. Grab the lever with the gripper  3. Pull up on the lever
 - When the robot's gripper is not above the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
 - When the robot's gripper is not around lever and robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
 - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the lever is below the robot's gripper
 - When the lever is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the lever is pulled up
