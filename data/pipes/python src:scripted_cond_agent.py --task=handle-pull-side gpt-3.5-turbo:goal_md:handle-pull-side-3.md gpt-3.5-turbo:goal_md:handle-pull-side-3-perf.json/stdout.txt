To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Lift the handle up
    First, move the robot's gripper so that it is around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the handle and then close the gripper around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is lifted up to the desired height.
