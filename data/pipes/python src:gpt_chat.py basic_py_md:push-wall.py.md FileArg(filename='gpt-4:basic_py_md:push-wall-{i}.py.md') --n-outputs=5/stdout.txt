# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot has encountered a wall"):
        robot.turn("left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
``` 

This should allow the robot to move left whenever it encounters a wall while pushing the puck towards the goal. However, keep in mind that the robot's movements and sensors may need to be customized based on the specifics of your robot's design and environment.
Here's the code for the `push_wall` function:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the wall")
    if check("the puck has hit the wall and the robot's gripper is above the puck"):
        robot.lift("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not between the wall and the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move("the gripper to the other side of the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```

This code makes sure that the gripper is in the correct position before attempting to move the puck. It then slides the puck to the wall, lifts the gripper, moves the gripper to the other side of the wall, and then slides the puck to the goal.
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    wall_height = 2  # height of the wall in inches
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move("gripper up by " + str(wall_height) + " inches")
        robot.slide("the puck to the wall")
        robot.move("gripper down by " + str(wall_height) + " inches")
        robot.push("the gripper through the wall and into the puck")
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper and the wall is not in front of the puck"):
        robot.slide("the puck until it hits the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wall and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("the puck around the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
Here's a program to perform the `push-wall` task:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        if check("there is a small wall in front of the puck"):
            robot.push("the wall out of the way")
            robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
        else:
            robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
``` 

This program begins by checking if the robot's gripper is in the correct position to pick up the puck. If not, it moves the gripper into position. Then it checks if the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the gripper. If so, it checks if there is a small wall in front of the puck. If there is, it moves the wall out of the way before sliding the puck to the goal. Otherwise, it just slides the puck to the goal.
