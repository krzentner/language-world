Then, complete the function:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the lever
    #  2. Grab the lever with the gripper
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the lever, so that we don't bump
    # it while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    # If the gripper isn't around the lever, put it around the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around lever")
    # If the gripper is near the lever and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around lever")
    # We closed the gripper, and the lever is still near the gripper, so maybe
    # we grabbed it.
    # Try to rotate the lever up.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the lever
2. Drop the gripper around lever
3. Pull the lever up

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lever"):
    robot.put("gripper above lever")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around lever")
if check("the robot's gripper is around lever"):
    robot.pull("lever up")


Then add the steps:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper around the lever
    #  2. Grip lever with gripper
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # To start, put the gripper around the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.put("gripper around the lever")
    # Now that the gripper is around the lever, grip it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("lever with gripper")
    # Now that we've got a grip on the lever, we can rotate it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```


Answer:
```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the lever
    #  2. Grab the lever with the gripper
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # Put the gripper above the lever, so that the gripper doesn't accidentally
    # hit the lever while grabbing it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    # Once the gripper is above the lever, grasp the lever with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("lever")
    # If the gripper is around the lever and the lever is not pointing up,
    # rotate it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the lever is not pointing up"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```


Then, add the necessary code:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper on the side of the lever
    #  2. Close the gripper around the lever
    #  3. Pull the lever up
    # We need to put the gripper to the side of the lever to make sure that it
    # grabs the lever securely. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not sideways aligned with lever"):
        robot.put("gripper to side of lever")
    # Now that the gripper is at the side of the lever, close it around the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is sideways aligned with lever and the gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around lever")
    # Now that the gripper is closed around the lever, try to pull the lever up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the lever and closed"):
        robot.pull("lever up")
