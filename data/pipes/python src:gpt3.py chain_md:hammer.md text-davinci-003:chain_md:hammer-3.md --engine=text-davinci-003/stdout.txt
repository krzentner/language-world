    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hammer  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper  3. Line the hammer up with the nail  4. Swing the hammer down to hit the nail  5. Pull the hammer back up 
    First, put the gripper above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, the robot should put gripper above hammer.
    If the hammer becomes right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the hammer.
    - When the hammer is not right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the hammer, the robot should grab hammer.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the hammer and the hammer isn't lined up with the nail, line up the hammer with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the hammer and the hammer is not horizontally aligned with nail, the robot should align hammer to nail.
    If the hammer is lined up with the nail, swing the hammer down to hit the nail.
    - When the hammer is horizontally aligned with nail, the robot should swing hammer down to hit nail.
    Once the hammer has hit the nail, pull the hammer back up.
    - When the hammer has hit the nail, the robot should pull hammer back up.
