 Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Drop gripper into the hole  3. Lift peg out of the hole  4. Move peg to goal
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg isn't below the gripper, move the gripper down into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in the hole and the peg is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is inside the hole, lift the peg up and out.
    - When the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg 
    If the peg is above the gripper, move the gripper above the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
