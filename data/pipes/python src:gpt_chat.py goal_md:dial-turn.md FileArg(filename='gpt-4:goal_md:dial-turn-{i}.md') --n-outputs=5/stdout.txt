To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the desired position
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper around the dial handle 2. Turn the dial to the desired position

First, put the gripper around the dial handle.
