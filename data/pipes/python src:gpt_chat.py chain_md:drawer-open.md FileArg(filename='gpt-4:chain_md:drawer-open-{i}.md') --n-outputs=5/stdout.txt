I'm sorry, it looks like there was a mistake in the task list - the `drawer-open` task was repeated. Did you mean to ask about a different task?
I'm sorry, it looks like you already included the steps for the `drawer-open` task in the initial prompt. Here are the steps again:

1. Put gripper above drawer handle
2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
3. Pull open the drawer
I'm sorry, it seems like a mistake. The task `drawer-open` was already defined and it appears again. However, to answer your question, to pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above drawer handle
2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
3. Pull open the drawer
I'm sorry, it looks like you already provided the steps for the `drawer-open` task in your original prompt. Here are the steps again:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Pull open the drawer

1. First, put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, move the gripper down around the handle to grab it.
3. Pull the gripper away from the drawer to open it.
I apologize, it seems there has been an error in the task list as `drawer-open` was already listed previously. 

If you meant to ask for the steps to perform the task `drawer-close`, then the robot should perform the following steps: 

1. Put the gripper roughly around the drawer handle 
2. Push the drawer closed 

If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction since we're just pushing the drawer. 

- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move gripper to drawer handle.

If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed. 

- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed.
