The robot should perform the following steps to complete the task `pick-out-of-hole`:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Lift the peg out of the hole and move it to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the gripper is around the peg, close the gripper to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    Once the peg is grabbed, lift it up and out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should lift it out from the hole.
    Finally, move the peg to the target location.
    - When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move it to the target location.
