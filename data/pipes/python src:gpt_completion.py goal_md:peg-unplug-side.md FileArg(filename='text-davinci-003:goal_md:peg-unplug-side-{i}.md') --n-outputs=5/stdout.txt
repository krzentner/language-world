Steps:  1. Put gripper over the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out of the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways to the left
    
Firstly, put the gripper over the peg. 
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
Secondly, if the peg isn't caught by the gripper yet, lower the gripper until the peg is trapped. 
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost closed
Now that the peg is trapped in the gripper, pull the peg out of the hole. 
- When the robot's gripper is almost closed, move the robot's gripper until the peg is no longer near the hole
Finally, slide the peg sideways to the left. 
- When the peg is no longer near the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is left of the robot's gripper

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the hole 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg is near the gripper, grab the peg with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and peg is not left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can just pull the peg out from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the peg is pulled out of the hole

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab peg with gripper  3. Pull peg out 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is forward aligned with the peg and closed, pull the peg out from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the peg is being pulled out from the side

    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the side at an angle 
    First, put the gripper above the peg, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
    Once we have the peg, pull it out while turning at an angle pointing away from the original insertion holes.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at an angle away from the insertion hole

Steps: 1. Put gripper slightly to the side of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out of the hole sideways
    To pull the peg out from the side, we first need to move the gripper slightly to the side of the peg.
    When the robot's gripper is not left of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    After we move the gripper slightly to the side of the peg, we can grab the peg with the gripper.
    When the robot's gripper is left of the peg and the robot's gripper is not around peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once we grab the peg, we can pull out the peg from the hole sideways. 
    When the robot's gripper is around peg, move the robotâ€™s gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the hole
