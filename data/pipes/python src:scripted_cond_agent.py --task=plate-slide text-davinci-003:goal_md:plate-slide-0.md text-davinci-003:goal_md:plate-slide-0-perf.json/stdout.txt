    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Close gripper around plate  4. Slide plate to target
    First, put the robot's gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, move it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, grab the plate tightly.
    - When the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near target location
