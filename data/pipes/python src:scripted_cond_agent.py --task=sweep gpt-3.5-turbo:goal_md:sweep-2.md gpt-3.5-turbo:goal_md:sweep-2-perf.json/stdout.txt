To perform the task `sweep`, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the cube  2. Close the gripper around the cube  3. Move the gripper sideways to the goal

First, put the robot's gripper above the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
Once the gripper is above the cube, close the gripper around the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is near the cube and the gripper is closed
Now that the gripper is holding the cube, move it sideways to the goal. 
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, move the robot's gripper until it's near the goal and then move the gripper sideways to reach the goal location.
