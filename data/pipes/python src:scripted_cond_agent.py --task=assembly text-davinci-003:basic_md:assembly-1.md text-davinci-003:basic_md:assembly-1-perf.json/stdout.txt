    - When the robot's gripper is not near wrench and wrench is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should move gripper above wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wrench and wrench is not horizontally aligned with the peg, the robot should align the wrench with peg.
    - When the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put wrench around peg.
