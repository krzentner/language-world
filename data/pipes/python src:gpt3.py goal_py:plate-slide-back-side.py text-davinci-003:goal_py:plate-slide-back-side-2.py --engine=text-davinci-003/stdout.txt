    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Line the plate up with the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate back sideways
    # First, put the gripper left of the plate.

    # If the plate is right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper left
    # of the plate.
    # Because the plate is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.

    # lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target
    # location.
    if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
    # If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, insert it.
