To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the ball is inside the gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, the robot should move the gripper above the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the ball is inside the gripper, the robot should throw the ball into the hoop.
To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should position the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the ball, the robot should move the gripper towards the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is near the hoop and the gripper is open, the robot should release the ball into the hoop.
To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should pick up the ball.
    - When the robot is near the hoop and the ball is inside the gripper, the robot should aim for the hoop and throw the ball into the hoop.
    - If the ball misses the hoop, the robot should retrieve the ball and repeat the process until successful.
To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the ball is not in the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the ball is in the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, the robot should move the gripper above the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the ball is in the robot's gripper, the robot should throw the ball into the hoop with enough force to ensure that it goes into the hoop.
To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and open, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball and the hoop is in front of the robot, the robot should move towards the hoop.
- When the robot is close enough to the hoop and the hoop is vertically aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should throw the ball towards the hoop, aiming for the center of the hoop. 
- After the ball has been thrown, the robot should release the gripper and return to its starting position.
