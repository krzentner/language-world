Steps:
1. Align the gripper vertically above the soccer ball.
2. Push the gripper into the top of the soccer ball.
3. Slide the soccer ball in the direction of the target location.
4. Push the soccer ball lightly with the gripper as necessary to adjust the direction.

```
# soccer: push the soccer ball into the target location
# def soccer(robot): 
    # Steps:
    #  1. Align the gripper vertically above the soccer ball.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball"):
        robot.put("gripper above the soccer ball")
    #  2. Push the gripper into the top of the soccer ball.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the top of the soccer ball")
    #  3. Slide the soccer ball in the direction of the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the soccer ball to the target location")
    #  4. Push the soccer ball lightly with the gripper as necessary to adjust
    # the direction.
    if check("the tennis ball is slightly incorrectly aligned with the target location"):
        robot.push("the soccer ball lightly with the gripper to adjust the direction")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above soccer ball
2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball
3. Slide soccer ball to goal

If the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the gripper above the soccer ball:

```
  if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
      robot.put("gripper above soccer ball")
```

If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, move the gripper downward to the soccer ball to start sliding it:

```
  if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball"):
      robot.push("gripper into soccer ball")
```

If the gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the gripper, then close the gripper around the soccer ball and start sliding it:

```
  if check("the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
      robot.close("gripper around soccer ball")
      robot.slide("soccer ball to goal")
```


The code should be:

```
# soccer: push the soccer ball into the target location
# def soccer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up robot's gripper above the soccer ball
    #  2. Push ball to goal
    # First, we need to move the gripper upperly above the soccer ball
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball"):
        robot.put("gripper above ball")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up above the soccer ball, we can push it to the goal
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball"):
        robot.push("ball to goal")
```


The program should perform the following steps:
1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball
2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper
3. Push the soccer ball to the target location

Solution:
```
# soccer: push the soccer ball into the target location
#def soccer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball
    #  2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper
    #  3. Push the soccer ball to the target location

    # Put the gripper above the soccer ball
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball"):
        robot.put("gripper above soccer ball")

    # Grab the soccer ball with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball"):
        robot.grab("soccer ball")

    # Push the soccer ball to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is around soccer ball"):
        robot.push("soccer ball to the target location")


Steps:

1. Put gripper above soccer ball
2. Push gripper into soccer ball
3. Slide soccer ball to goal

If the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move it above the soccer ball.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball"):
    robot.put("gripper above soccer ball")
```

If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, move the gripper down to the soccer ball to slide it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball"):
    robot.push("gripper into the soccer ball")
```

If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the ball and can slide it to the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.slide("soccer ball to the goal")
```
