To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
- When the peg is left of the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper to the right of the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is aligned with the hole, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
