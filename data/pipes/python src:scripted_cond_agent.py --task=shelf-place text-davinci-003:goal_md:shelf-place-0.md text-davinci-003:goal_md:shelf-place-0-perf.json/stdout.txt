    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Drop gripper around the block  3. Close gripper around the block  4. Move block to target location  5. Open gripper at target location 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    If the gripper is near the target location, we can then release the block by opening the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
