The steps the robot should perform to push the soccer ball into the target location reliably are:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not in front of soccer ball, the robot should move gripper in front of soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball to goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should push the gripper into the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball, the robot should slide the soccer ball to the goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with soccer ball, the robot should turn gipper in front of soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push soccer ball towards the target location.

    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, the robot should move gripper to the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball downward to the target location.
    - When the soccer ball has almost reached the target location, the robot should push the soccer ball with light force until the soccer ball reaches the target location.

    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, the robot should move gripper to above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and is not pushing the soccer ball, the robot should push the soccer ball.
    - When the soccer ball is being pushed by the robot's gripper, the robot should push the soccer ball to the goal.
