    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to wall  4. Push against wall with puck  5. Slide puck to goal
    The robot should first put the gripper above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall
    Now the robot can move the puck towards the wall, then push the wall with the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the puck is touching the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
