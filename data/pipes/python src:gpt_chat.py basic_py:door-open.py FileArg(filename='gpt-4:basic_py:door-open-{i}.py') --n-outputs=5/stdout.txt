Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Sorry, it looks like we have a duplicate function here. The function for door-open has already been defined above. Is there anything else you need help with?
Sorry, we already have a function for opening the door in the code above. Did you mean to suggest something else?
It seems like we already have a function called `door_open` defined earlier. Should we rename one of them to avoid any confusion?
Sorry, there seems to be a duplicate function already defined. Here's the corrected version of the code without the duplicate function:

# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")

# push: slide the puck to the target location
# def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")

# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
# def pick_place(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")

# door-open: pull the door open
# def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.pull("door open")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
# def drawer_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")

# drawer-close: push the drawer close
# def drawer_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")

# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")

# peg-insert-side: insert the peg into the hole from the side
# def peg_insert_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.align("peg to hole")
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.insert("peg into hole")

# window-open: slide the window open to the left
# def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
I'm sorry, but we already have a "door-open" function defined in the code you provided. Do you want me to suggest another function for you to create?
