Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
I think the code for the `reach` function was accidentally repeated. Here's the correct implementation of the `reach` function:

```
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```
I'm sorry, it looks like we already defined the function for reaching to the target location. Did you mean to ask for something else?
Sure, I can help with that! Would you like me to write the code for the "reach" function?
I believe this function was already implemented earlier. Here it is again for your reference:

```
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the reach target"):
        robot.reach("to the goal")
```

Is there anything else you need help with?
I'm sorry, it seems like you have already defined the reach function earlier. Do you want me to suggest any edits or changes to the existing function?
