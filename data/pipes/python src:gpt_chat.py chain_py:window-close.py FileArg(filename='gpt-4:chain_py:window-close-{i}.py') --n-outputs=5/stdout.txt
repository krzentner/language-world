Oops, it looks like you accidentally copied and pasted the code for the previous function. Here's the correct code for closing the window:

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be behind the window handle,
    # push harder to close the window.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
# Steps:
#  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
#  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
#  3. Push the window closed harder
# If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
# gripper near the window handle to start pushing
if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
    robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
# If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
# window close now by moving the gripper right.
if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
    robot.slide("window right")
# If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
# push harder.
if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
    robot.push("window right harder")
I think you accidentally repeated the previous function, "window-close". Did you mean to write a different function?
Oops, there seems to be a mistake here - we already have a function for window_close above. Did you mean to add an additional function or modify the existing one?
Oops, it looks like there was a copy-paste error in your code. Here's the corrected version:

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
