Steps:  1. Put gripper above wall  2. Move gripper to left of wall  3. Reach above wall to the target location
First, put the gripper above the wall so that it lines up with the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall 
If the gripper isn't to the left of the wall, move to the left of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not to the left of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the left of the wall
Now that the gripper is above and to the left of the wall, reach above the wall to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above wall and to the left of wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
