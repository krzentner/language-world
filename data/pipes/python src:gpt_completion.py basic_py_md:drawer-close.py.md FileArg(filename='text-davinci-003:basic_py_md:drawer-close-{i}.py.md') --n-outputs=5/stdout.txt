Finish with the text:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
```

Answer:

```
# drawer-close: push the drawer close
# def drawer_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
```


Here is the program to perform the task `drawer-close`:

```
# drawer-close: push the drawer close
# def drawer_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
``


Then the rest of the program:
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
```


The program should contain the following code:

```
# drawer-close: push the drawer close
def drawer_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
```


Solution:

```
# drawer-close: push the drawer close
# def drawer_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
```
