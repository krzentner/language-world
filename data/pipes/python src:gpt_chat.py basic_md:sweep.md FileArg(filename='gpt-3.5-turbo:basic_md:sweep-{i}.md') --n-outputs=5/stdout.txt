To execute the `sweep` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the gripper is not above the cube and the cube is not vertically aligned with the gripper, the robot should position the gripper above the cube.
- When the gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the gripper is closed around the cube and the cube is relatively far from the target location, the robot should move sideways while holding the cube until the robot is near the target location.
- When the gripper is near the target location and the cube is still held securely, the robot should release the cube at the target location.
To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should lift the cube off the surface.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move to the left or right while gripping the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.

- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the cube is gripped and the gripper is closed, the robot should move the gripper and cube towards the target location sideways.
- When the robot's gripper reaches the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
