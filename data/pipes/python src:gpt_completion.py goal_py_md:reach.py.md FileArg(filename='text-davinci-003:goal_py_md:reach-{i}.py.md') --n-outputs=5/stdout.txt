The program should read:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
```


Below is the program:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
```


Here's the program to perform the task `reach`:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
```


Then add the code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
```


The program should check if the robot's gripper is not near the target, and if so, move the gripper near the target.

```
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
```
