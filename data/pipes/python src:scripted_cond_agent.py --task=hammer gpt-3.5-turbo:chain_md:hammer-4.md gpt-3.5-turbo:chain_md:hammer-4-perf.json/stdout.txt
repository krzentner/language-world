The task `hammer` requires the robot to hit the nail with the hammer. To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Hold the hammer near the top of the handle  2. Line up the hammer with the nail  3. Swing the hammer down onto the nail
    First, hold the hammer near the top of the handle as it gives better control.
    - When the robot's gripper is not holding the hammer or is holding the hammer incorrectly, the robot should pick up the hammer correctly.
    Next, line up the hammer with the nail head.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the head of the nail or it is not above the nail, the robot should place hammer above the nail head.
    Finally, swing the hammer down onto the head of the nail with enough force to drive it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the head of the nail and the hammer is over the nail, the robot should swing the hammer down onto the nail with the desired force.
