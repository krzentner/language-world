    Steps:  1. Find a suitable throwing angle from the robot's position  2. Raise the gripper to the throwing angle  3. Release the ball from the gripper  4. Push the ball towards the hoop
    We can start by finding a suitable angle from the robot's position before starting to throw the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at a suitable throwing angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at a suitable throwing angle
    When the robot's gripper is at a suitable throwing angle, we can now raise the gripper to the throwing angle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the throwing angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the throwing angle
    Once the gripper is in position, we can release the ball from the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the throwing angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and the robot's gripper is away from the ball
    Finally, to push the ball towards the hoop, carefully release the ball and move the robot's gripper away from the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is away from the ball and finger will not touch the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from the ball and the ball is in front of the hoop


    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball  3. Push the ball towards the hoop  4. Release the grip when the ball is close to the hoop   
    First, put the gripper roughly above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    We need to grab the ball to push it. Once the gripper is around the ball, close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now we move the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the hoop and the robot is releasing the grip on the ball
    Once the ball is close to the hoop, release the grip so it can shoot it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the hoop and the robot is gripping the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is releasing the grip on the ball

    Steps:  1. Put gripper over the ball  2. Line up the ball with the hoop  3. Drop the ball in the hoop
    First, put the gripper roughly over the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the ball isn't lined up with the hoop, we should line it up by moving gripper forward and back.
    - When the ball is not almost aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper until the ball is almost always aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the ball is lined up with the hoop, just drop the ball in the hoop.
    - When the ball is aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the ball

    Steps:  1. Place the robot's gripper above the ball  2. Drop the robot's gripper around the ball  3. Close the robot's gripper around the ball  4. Move the robot's gripper towards the hoop  5. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, place the robot's gripper above the ball so we can trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball
    If the gripper isn't around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the ball, we can now move it towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is close to the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the hoop 
    When the gripper and the ball are in front of the hoop, release the ball and watch it fall into the hoop. 
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the hoop and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open


    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball and close the gripper  3. Line up the ball in front of the hoop  4. Lift arm up and push ball towards the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    Next, if the gripper is not around the ball, put it around the ball and close the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the ball is secure, move the robot's arm up and line up the ball in front of the hoop.
    - When the ball is not horizontally aligned with the hoop, move the robot's arm until the ball is horizontally aligned with the hoop
    To push the ball into the hoop, lift the robot's arm up and push the ball into hoop with the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's arm is raised and the ball is horizontal aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the ball is in the hoop
