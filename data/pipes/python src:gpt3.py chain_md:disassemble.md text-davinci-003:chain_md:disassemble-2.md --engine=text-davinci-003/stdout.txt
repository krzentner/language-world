Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench away from the peg  4. Move the wrench away from the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench so that it will be easier to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should move gripper above wrench.
    If the wrench is below the gripper, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, the robot should grab wrench.
    As long as the gripper is still around the wrench, pull the wrench away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, the robot should pull wrench away from peg.
    If the wrench is pulled away from the peg, move the wrench away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not near the peg, the robot should move wrench away from peg.
