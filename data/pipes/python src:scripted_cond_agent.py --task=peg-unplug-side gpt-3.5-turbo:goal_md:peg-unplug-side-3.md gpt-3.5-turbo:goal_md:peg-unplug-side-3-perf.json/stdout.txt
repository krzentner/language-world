To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Move the gripper away from the hole along the peg's axis  4. Slide the peg out of the hole sideways
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg is not fully gripped by the gripper, grab it securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not gripping the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is gripping the peg
    Move the gripper away from the hole along the peg's axis. Then slide the peg out of the hole sideways.
    - When the peg is gripping the gripper and the gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper away from the hole along the peg's axis
    - When the robot's gripper is away from the hole and the peg is not aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is out of the hole sideways.
