To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper close to the stick handle  2. Grab the stick handle with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos handle  4. Put the gripper around the thermos handle  5. Pull the thermos towards the target location while holding the stick 

First, put the gripper close to the stick handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not close to the stick handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the stick handle
Once the gripper is close to the stick handle, grab the stick handle with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the stick handle and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick handle
Now, line up the stick with the thermos handle.
- When the stick is not aligned with the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper until the stick is aligned with the thermos handle
Once the stick is aligned with the thermos handle, put the gripper around the thermos handle and close it to grip the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the thermos handle but is not around it and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the thermos handle and then close the gripper
Finally, pull the thermos towards the target location while holding the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while holding the stick.
