    Steps:  1. Move the robot's gripper to the ball  2. Close the gripper to pick up the ball  3. Move the robot's gripper to the hoop  4. Line the ball up in front of the hoop  5. Push the ball into the hoop
    First, move the gripper to the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the ball, the robot should move gripper towards ball.
    If the gripper is near the ball, close the gripper to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around ball.
    If the ball is held by the gripper, move the gripper to the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding ball and the ball is not lined up with hoop, the robot should move gripper towards hoop.
    As long as the ball is aligned with the hoop, we can just slide it in. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hoop and the ball is aligned with the hoop, the robot should push ball into hoop.
