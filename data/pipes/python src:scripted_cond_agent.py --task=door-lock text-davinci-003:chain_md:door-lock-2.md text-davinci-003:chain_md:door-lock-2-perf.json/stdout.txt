    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial in the specified direction  3. Increase pressure to keep dial turning until it is locked 
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around the dial.
    Now that the gripper is around the dial, we can turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the specified direction.
    If the dial isn't turning, increase the pressure while continuing to turn the dial until it's locked.
    - When the dial is not locked and the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should increase pressure on the dial.
