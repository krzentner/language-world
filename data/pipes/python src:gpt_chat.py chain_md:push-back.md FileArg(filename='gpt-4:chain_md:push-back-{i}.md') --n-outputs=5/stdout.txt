To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck backwards to goal
    The robot can slide the puck backwards by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it backwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal.
To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck
    We need to put the gripper above the puck before we can slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we can slide it backwards. Move the gripper downwards, and slide the puck while holding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal while holding it with the gripper.
To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck backwards to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on its back and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it backwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the back of the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the back of the puck.
    If the gripper is near the back of the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the back of the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal.
To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck   2. Push gripper into bottom of puck  3. Slide puck backwards towards goal
    The robot can slide the puck backwards by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the bottom of the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards towards the goal.
To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
