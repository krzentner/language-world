     Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the button at a distance  2. Drop the gripper down while pushing the wall away  3. Push the button down from above
     To avoid getting blocked by the wall, the robot needs to put the gripper at a distance left of the button.
      - When the robot's gripper is not left of the button at a distance, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the button at an appropriate distance
     To avoid hitting the wall while pushing the button, the robot needs to be careful about the direction it moves in.
      - When the robot's gripper is left of the button at a distance and the robot's gripper is not dropping down, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the button at a distance and the robot's gripper is dropping down
    Once the robot's gripper is dropping down, move it until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
