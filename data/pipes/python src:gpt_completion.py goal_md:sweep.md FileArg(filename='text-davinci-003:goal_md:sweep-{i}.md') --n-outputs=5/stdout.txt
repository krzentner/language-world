Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the cube  2. Line up the gripper and cube side by side  3. Grab the cube with the gripper  4. Move the cube to the target location
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
   If the cube is left of the robot's gripper as seen from the front, try to line up the cube and gripper side by side. If the gripper is above the cube, move the gripper down until it is around the cube.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
   Once the gripper is around the cube and horizontally aligned with it, we can grab the cube.
   - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Pick up cube with gripper  4. Move the cube sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube, with the gripper slightly open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is slightly open
    Once the gripper is aligned, close it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    The cube should be gripping now and the robot can pick it up and move it sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to the target location
    First, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper is not around the cube, the robot needs to move the gripper around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the cube, the robot can start moving the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location 
    


    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed 
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper in the direction of the target location until the robot's gripper is near the target location


Steps:    1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Move the cube sideways to the target location  4. Let go of the cube

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, open the gripper and move the robot's gripper away from the target location
