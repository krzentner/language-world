Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move robot's hand to goal

    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.

        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
