    Steps:  1. Put gripper slightly above the forwall  2. Reach for wall above puck  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal using wall as lever
    First, put the gripper slightly above the wall. The wall will add some height, so this will get the gripper in the right spot to reach the puck while giving us a leverage point.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, try to reach the puck above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wall and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open
    When the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the puck
    When the gripper is above the puck and near the target location, push down on the wall to leverage the puck up, and then slide it over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
