    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the wrench handle  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull up on the wrench handle 
	
	If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, we should move the gripper near the wrench handle to start pulling.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, the robot should put gripper below wrench handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the wrench handle, close the gripper around the wrench and start pulling it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab wrench handle.
    If the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, pull the wrench off the peg by pulling up and away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench handle, the robot should pull up on wrench.
