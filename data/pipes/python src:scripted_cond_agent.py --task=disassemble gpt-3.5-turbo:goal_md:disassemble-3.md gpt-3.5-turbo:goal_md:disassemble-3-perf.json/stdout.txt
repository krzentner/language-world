To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper next to the handle of the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench up and away from the peg
    First, put the gripper next to the handle of the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is next to the wrench, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is next to the handle of the wrench and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    After grabbing the wrench, lift it up and away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is still on the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper lifts the wrench up and away from the peg
