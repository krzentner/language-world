    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should move gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate, the robot should grab the plate from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate sideways to the target location.
