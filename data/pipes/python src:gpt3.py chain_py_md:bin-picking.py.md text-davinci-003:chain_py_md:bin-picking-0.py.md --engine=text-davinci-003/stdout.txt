Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the cube
2. Drop the gripper around the cube
3. Close the gripper around the cube
4. Move the cube up to the target bin
5. Place the cube in the bin

If the robot's gripper is not above the cube, we'll have to move it there.

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
    robot.put("gripper above cube")

Once the gripper is above the cube, we should be able to drop it around the cube by moving it down.

if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around cube")

Once the gripper is around the cube, we can close the gripper to trap the cube.

if check("the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around cube")

Once the gripper is closed around the cube, we can move the cube up to the target bin.

if check("the robot's gripper is closed around cube"):
    robot.move("cube up to bin")

Once the cube is in position, we can push the cube into the bin.

if check("the cube is above the bin"):
    robot.place("cube in bin")
