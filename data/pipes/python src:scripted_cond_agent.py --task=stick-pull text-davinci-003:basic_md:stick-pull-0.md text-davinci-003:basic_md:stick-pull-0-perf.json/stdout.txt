The robot should perform the following steps to use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably: 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the thermos and the robot's gripper is around the stick, the robot should lift the thermos horizontally.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos, the robot should pull the thermos to the goal.
