Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Push the wall with the gripper  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, try pushing the wall before dragging the puck away.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the wall is no longer blocking the path to the goal
    If the wall has been pushed out of the way, just drag the puck away normally.
    - When the wall is no longer blocking the path to goal, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
