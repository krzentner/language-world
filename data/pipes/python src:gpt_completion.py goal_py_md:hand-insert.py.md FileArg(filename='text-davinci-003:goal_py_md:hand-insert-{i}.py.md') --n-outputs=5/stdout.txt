The steps for this task would be:
1. Put gripper above the puck
2. Drop gripper around the puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Insert puck into the target location 

The code for this task would be:

```
# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
# def hand_insert(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Insert puck into the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Now, once the gripper is near the target, we can insert the puck into the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("into the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the puck
3. Close the gripper around the puck
4. Move the puck to the goal

If the robot's gripper is not already above the puck, move it there. We don't need to worry about the orientation of the gripper, so this should be a relatively straightforward move.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper isn't around the puck, move it around the puck so that the gripper has a hold of the puck. We don't need to worry too much about the orientation of the gripper here either - the aim is to get it in the vicinity of the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the end of the gripper is in the vicinity of the puck, close the gripper so that it can securely hold the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

Finally, move the puck and the gripper to the goal, making sure that the gripper does not lose its grip on the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the puck
  2. Move gripper above the target location
  3. Drop the puck into the target location
  
If the robot's gripper is not roughly above the puck, move it to be right above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
        
If the target location is not above the puck, move the gripper to the target location.
    if check("the target location is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
        
If the gripper is above the target, drop the puck into the target location by slowly releasing the gripper.        
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=False)


Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move puck to target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the gripper above the puck.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck and close the gripper.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the puck and closed, move to the target location.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the puck
2. Drop gripper around the puck
3. Close the gripper around the puck
4. Move the puck to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not roughly above puck, move it there.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
```

If the gripper is not around the puck, move it there.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is near the puck and closed, move the puck to the target location.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
