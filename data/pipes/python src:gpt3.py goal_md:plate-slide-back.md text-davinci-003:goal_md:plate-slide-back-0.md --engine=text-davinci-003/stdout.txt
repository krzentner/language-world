    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Slide the plate back into target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the robot's gripper is above the plate, we can slide it back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is around the plate, we can slide the plate back by moving the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
