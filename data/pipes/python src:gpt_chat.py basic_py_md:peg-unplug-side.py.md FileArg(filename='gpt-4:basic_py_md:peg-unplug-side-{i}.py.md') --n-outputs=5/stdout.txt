This program controls the robot to pull the peg out from the side. The robot first checks if it is aligned with the peg and if it is, it grabs the peg. Then it checks if it is horizontally aligned with the hole and rotates the gripper to the side of the peg. Finally, the gripper pulls the peg out of the hole.
