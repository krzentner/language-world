To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck: Move the gripper above the puck, so that we don't accidentally hit the puck while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.

2. Drop gripper around puck: Move the gripper down to the level of puck and around the puck. It should now be positioned to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.

3. Close gripper around puck: Close the gripper around the puck to hold it. We may need to adjust the position of the puck to ensure a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.

4. Move puck to goal: Lift the gripper with the puck still held, and move it towards the target location. Release the puck once it is in the desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the puck to goal.

By following these steps, the robot should be able to reliably pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
