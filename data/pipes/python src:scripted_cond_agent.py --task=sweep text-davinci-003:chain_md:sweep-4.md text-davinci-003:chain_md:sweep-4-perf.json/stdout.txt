    Steps:  1. Move gripper above cube  2. Put gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways  5. Place cube at goal
    First, move the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should move gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, place it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not closed, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Now that the gripper is closed, we can move the cube sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube sideways.
    Lastly, place the cube at the goal.
    - When the cube is sideways to the robot, the robot should place cube at goal.
