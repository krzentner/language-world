The robot can push the soccer ball by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper.
If the soccer ball isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the soccer ball.

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the soccer ball")

# If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, move the gripper
# down to the soccer ball to slide it.
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the soccer ball", close_gripper=True)

# If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can
# slide it to the target location.
# Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
if check("the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
 

Steps:
1. Put gripper above soccer ball
2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball
3. Push soccer ball to goal

    if check("the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball"):

The robot can move the soccer ball by trapping it by pushing down on it from
above and moving the gripper.

If the soccer ball isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
above the soccer ball.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the soccer ball")
``` 

If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, move the gripper
down to the soccer ball to slide it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the soccer ball", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can
slide it to the target location.
 Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the soccer ball 
2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball 
3. Slide soccer ball to target location 

If the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the gripper to be vertically aligned with the soccer ball.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the soccer ball")
```

If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, we can move the gripper down to the soccer ball and trap it before pushing it to the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the soccer ball", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we can slide the soccer ball to the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```


Then use the steps from the other tasks to fill in the procedure.
