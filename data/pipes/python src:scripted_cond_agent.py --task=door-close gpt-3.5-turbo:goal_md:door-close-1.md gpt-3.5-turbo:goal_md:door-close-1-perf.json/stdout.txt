To push the door closed to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the edge of the door  2. Push the door closed to the target location
    If the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the door, move the gripper near the edge of the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the edge of the door
    If the robot's gripper is aligned with the door from the front, we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the door from the front, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the edge of the door. 
    Once the robot's gripper is around the edge of the door, we can push it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the edge of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is facing towards the target location and the robot's gripper is closed. Then push the door until it reaches the target location.
