To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the puck is in the gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is beside the wall, the robot should lift the gripper and move it above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall and the goal location is visible, the robot should move the gripper towards the goal location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
