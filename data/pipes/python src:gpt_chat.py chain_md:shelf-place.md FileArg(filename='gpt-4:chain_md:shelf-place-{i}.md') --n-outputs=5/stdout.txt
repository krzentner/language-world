To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
    1. Put gripper above block
    2. Lower gripper around block
    3. Lift block
    4. Move gripper above target location
    5. Lower block at target location

First, put the gripper roughly above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should put gripper above the block.
Move the gripper down to grab the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the block, the robot should move gripper down around the block.
Close the gripper to hold the block securely.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and open, the robot should close gripper around block.
Lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and closed, the robot should lift the block.
Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should move gripper above target location.
Lower the block at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the block at target location.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place gripper above the block.
2. Move the gripper down to the block to pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the block.
3. Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the block, the robot should lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should place the block at the target location by opening the gripper.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the block  2. Drop the gripper around the block  3. Close the gripper around the block  4. Move the block to the goal location  5. Open the gripper to release the block
    First, place the gripper above the block to prepare for grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should put the gripper above the block.
    Once the gripper is above the block, drop the gripper around the block to start grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
    Close the gripper around the block, and make sure the block is secure to hold it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
    Move the block to the goal location.
    - When the robot is holding the block, the robot should move the block to the goal location.
    Open the gripper to release the block.
    - When the block is at the goal location and the gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper to release the block.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Lift block up  5. Move block to the target location  6. Lower block down  7. Open gripper to release the block
    First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place gripper above the block.
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the block.
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
    We closed the gripper, and the block is still attached to the surface, so we probably grabbed it. Lift the block up.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the block and the block is attached to the surface, the robot should lift the block up.
    Move the block to the target location.
    - When the robot is holding the block, the robot should move the block to the target location.
    Once the block is near the target location, lower the block down to place it at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the block down to place it at the target location.
    Finally, open the gripper to release the block.
    - When the block has been placed at the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the block.
To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Lift the block up  4. Move the block to the target location  5. Lower the block to place it at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, the robot should put gripper above block.
    If the gripper is not around the block, grab the block with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the block.
    Once the block is grabbed, lift the block up.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should lift the block up.
    Once the block is lifted, move the block to the target location.
    - Once the block is lifted, the robot should move the block to the target location.
    Once the block is at the target location, lower the block to place it.
    - When the block is at the target location, the robot should lower the block to place it at the target location.
