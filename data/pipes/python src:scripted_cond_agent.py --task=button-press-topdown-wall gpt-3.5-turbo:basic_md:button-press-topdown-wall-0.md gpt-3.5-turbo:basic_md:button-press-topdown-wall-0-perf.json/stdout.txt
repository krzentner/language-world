To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    - When there is a short wall between the robot's gripper and the button, the robot should move its gripper to one side of the wall to get a clear path to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and there is no obstacle in the way, the robot should push down on button.
