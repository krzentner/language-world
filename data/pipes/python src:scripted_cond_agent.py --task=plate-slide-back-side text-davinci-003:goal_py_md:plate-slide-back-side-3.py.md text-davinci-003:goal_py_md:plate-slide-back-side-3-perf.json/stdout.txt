Steps:

1. Put gripper near the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Slide the plate back sideways towards the target location

If the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move it to the plate. Then grab the plate with the gripper.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
```

Now we can start sliding the plate backwards towards the target location. To do that, we first need to make sure the plate is horizontally aligned with the target.

```
if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target")
```

Finally, we can push the plate sideways into the target location.

```
if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the target and the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("away from the target location")
```
