    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is Forward aligned with the plate move the gripper down to grab the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, the robot should grab plate.
    Now that the gripper is around the plate, try to line it up with the target location. Move the gripper one side or the other until it's lined up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should line plate up with target location.
    If it's lined up, slide it into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with target location, the robot should slide plate into target location.
