    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Place the wrench around the peg  4. Close the wrench around the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    If the wrench becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the wrench. Because the wrench is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab wrench.
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, place it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not around the peg, the robot should place wrench around peg.
    Finally, close the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the wrench is around the peg, the robot should close wrench around peg.
