Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
I'm sorry, I couldn't find a task called "hand_insert" in the previous code. Could you please provide more information or context about what this task should achieve?
# Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper close to the puck
    #  2. Pick up the puck
    #  3. Move the gripper to the target
    #  4. Release the puck
    # Although this is called "hand-insert", we'll use the gripper to pick up
    # and move the puck.
    # First, move the gripper close to the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck")
    # If the gripper is near the puck but not around it, grab the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper has the puck, move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and not near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Release the puck at the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location", open_gripper=True)
# Steps:
    #  1. Put the hand above the puck
    #  2. Grab the puck with the hand
    #  3. Move the puck to the target location
    # First, put the hand above the puck.
    if check("the hand is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_hand("above the puck")
    # If the hand is roughly above the puck, grab the puck.
    if check("the hand is above the puck and the hand is not holding the puck"):
        robot.move_hand("around the puck", close_hand=True)
    # If the hand is holding the puck, move the hand to the target location.
    if check("the hand is holding the puck and the hand is not above the target location"):
        robot.move_hand("above the target location")
# Steps:
    #  1. Put hand above the puck
    #  2. Use fingers to grab the puck
    #  3. Move hand to target location
    #  4. Use fingers to release the puck
    # Use the same logic as in pick_place() to first put the hand above the puck.
    if check("the robot's hand is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_hand("above the puck")
    # If the hand isn't grabing the puck, use the fingers to grab it.
    if check("the robot's hand is not grabbing the puck"):
        robot.grab_puck()
    # Move the hand to the target location. We can use similar logic as in reach().
    if check("the robot's hand is not near target location"):
        robot.move_hand("near the target location")
    # Release the puck by opening the fingers.
    if check("the robot's hand is grabbing the puck and the hand is near the target location"):
        robot.release_puck()
# Steps:
    #  1. Move hand above the puck, open fingers
    #  2. Close fingers around puck
    #  3. Move hand to target location, open fingers
    # First, put the hand above the puck with fingers open.
    if check("the robot's hand is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_hand("above the puck", open_fingers=True)
    # If the hand is above the puck with fingers open, close the fingers around
    # the puck to pick it up.
    if check("the robot's hand is above the puck and the fingers are open"):
        robot.move_hand("around the puck", close_fingers=True)
    # Once the hand is around the puck, move it to the target location and open
    # the fingers to place it.
    if check("the robot's hand is around the puck"):
        robot.move_hand("above the target location", open_fingers=True)
