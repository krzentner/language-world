    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wall, the robot should put gripper above wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should push the gripper into the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the wall is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the wall away from the puck.
    - When the wall is between the puck and the target location and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should move the gripper near the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
