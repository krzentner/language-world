To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

   Steps:  1. Put gripper around the button  2. Move the gripper close to the button  3. Press the button from the front by moving the gripper forward
    First, put the gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the button and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not close to the button, move the gripper closer.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    If there is a short wall in the way, push the gripper forward to press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button and the robot's gripper is closed
The robot should perform the following steps to push the button from the front with a short wall in the way:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Move gripper forward until gripper is touching the wall  3. Slide gripper along the wall until gripper is above the button  4. Push down on the button from the front
First, put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
If the wall is in the way, move the gripper forward until it is touching the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not touching the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the wall
Slide the gripper along the wall until it is above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button and gripper is not sliding along the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sliding along the wall and the robot's gripper is above the button
Now that the gripper is above the button, push down on the button from the front to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the button on the open side of the wall 2. Line up the gripper with the button from the front  3. Push the button from the front

First, put the gripper near the button on the open side of the wall, where there is enough space to reach the button.
	- When the robot's gripper is not near the button on the open side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until it's near the button on the open side of the wall

Next, line up the gripper with the button from the front by moving it to a position where it can push the button.
	- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until it is aligned with the button from the front

Finally, push the button from the front until the button is fully pressed or the task is complete.
	- While pushing the button, check if the button is fully pressed. If not, continue pushing until it is fully pressed.
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper in front of the button and wall  2. Move gripper to top of the button  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the gripper in front of the button and wall so that we can see the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button and the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the button and the wall
    Once the gripper is lined up with the button and the wall, move the gripper to the top of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    After the gripper is above the button, push down on the button to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the button  2. Move the robot's gripper forward until it touches the wall  3. Slide the gripper downwards until it is below the wall  4. Move the robot's gripper forward again until it touches the button  5. Push down on the button from the front
Since there is a short wall in the way, the robot needs to approach the button from above. Once it is above the button:
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper forward until it touches the wall
    We need to slide the gripper downwards until it is below the wall to avoid hitting it as we move the gripper forward again:
    - When the robot's gripper touches the wall, move the robot's gripper downwards until it is below the wall
    Now we can move the gripper forward again until it touches the button:
    - When the robot's gripper is below the wall, move the robot's gripper forward again until it touches the button
Finally, we can push down on the button from the front to activate it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
