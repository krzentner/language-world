Steps:  1. Line up gripper as viewed from above, then slightly above wall  2. Push down on the button from above
    First, line up the gripper from above but slightly higher than the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and not higher than the wall, the robot should line up the gripper as viewed from above and slightly higher than wall.
    When the gripper is lined up above the wall, we can move the gripper down slightly to push the button down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and higher than the wall, the robot should push down on the button from the top.
