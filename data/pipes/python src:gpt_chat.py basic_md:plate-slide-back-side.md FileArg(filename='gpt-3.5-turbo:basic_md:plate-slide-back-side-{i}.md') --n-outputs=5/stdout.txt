To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper above the plate and align the plate with the target location.
  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the plate is not within the gripper range, the robot should move the gripper closer to the plate.
  - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should slide the plate back sideways to the target location.
  - Once the plate is in the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the plate.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should slide the plate back into the target location sideways.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate to the target location by moving the gripper sideways without lifting the plate too high.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above the plate.
- When the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should push the plate towards the target location while keeping it aligned and parallel to the surface it is on.
- When the plate reaches the target location, the robot should release its grip on the plate.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not in front of the gripper, the robot should move the gripper above the plate and position it at the side of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
