# Steps:
#  1. Scan the bin to locate the cube
#  2. Put the gripper above the cube
#  3. Grab the cube with the gripper
#  4. Move the cube to the target bin

# First, the robot needs to scan the bin to locate the cube. This can be done through
# a combination of visual recognition and movement planning.
