To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the basketball  2. Grab the basketball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper over to the hoop  4. Adjust the grip on the basketball for throwing  5. Throw the basketball into the hoop

First, put the gripper above the basketball.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the basketball, the robot should put gripper above the basketball.
Once the gripper is above the basketball, grasp it with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the basketball and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the basketball.
Move the gripper over to the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the basketball, move the gripper over to the hoop.
Adjust the grip on the basketball for throwing by lifting it up and positioning it for the throw.
- When the robot's gripper is positioned over the hoop and the basketball is in the correct position for the throw, the robot should adjust the grip on the basketball for throwing.
Throw the basketball into the hoop.
- When the basketball is positioned correctly for throwing, the robot should throw the basketball into the hoop.
