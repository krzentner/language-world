# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"): # check if the gripper is not already at the target
        robot.reach("to goal") # move the gripper to the target location
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")

# Replace "to goal" with the specific location you want the robot to reach. Also, make sure to define the `check` function somewhere. This function should take in a string as an argument and return a boolean indicating whether or not that condition is met for the robot's gripper.
Here's the complete code for the `reach` task:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move("gripper to reach target")
```

This code checks if the robot's gripper is not already near the reach target and moves the gripper to the target location if necessary. It assumes that the `robot` object has a `move` method that moves the gripper to a given location, and that the `check` function returns `True` if the given condition is met (in this case, if the gripper is not near the reach target). Note that the specific implementation of the `move` and `check` methods will depend on the specifics of the robot hardware and software being used.
# reach: reach to the target location
# def reach(robot):
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move("gripper to the target location")
        robot.grab("target")
        robot.lift("target")
        robot.move("target to goal")
        robot.release("target at goal")
