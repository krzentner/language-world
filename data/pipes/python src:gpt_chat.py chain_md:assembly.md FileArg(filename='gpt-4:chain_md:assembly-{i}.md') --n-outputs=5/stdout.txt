To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put the wrench near the peg  2. Align the opening of the wrench with the peg  3. Move the wrench around the peg
    First, put the wrench near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move the wrench near the peg.
    Align the opening of the wrench with the peg.
    - When the opening of the wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should align the opening of the wrench with the peg.
    Move the wrench around the peg to close around it.
    - When the wrench opening is aligned with the peg, move the wrench around the peg to close it around the peg.
The task `assembly` requires the robot to put the wrench around the peg. To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench and peg  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper and position it around the peg  3. Close the gripper to hold the wrench in place
    First, put the gripper above the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench and peg, the robot should put gripper above the wrench and peg.
    Grab the wrench with the gripper and move it towards the peg, positioning it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and peg and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the wrench and position it around the peg.
    Close the gripper to hold the wrench in place around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and peg and the gripper is closed, the robot should hold the wrench in place.
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put the gripper near the wrench and the peg  2. Open the gripper around the wrench  3. Insert the peg into the wrench  4. Close the gripper around the peg and the wrench
    First, the robot should position its gripper near both the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the peg, the robot should put gripper near the wrench and the peg.
    Once the gripper is close enough to the wrench, open the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is not open, the robot should open the gripper around the wrench.
    Once the wrench is open, position the peg into the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should insert the peg into the wrench.
    Finally, close the gripper to hold the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper has both the wrench and the peg, the robot should close the gripper around them both.
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

   Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Position gripper above the peg  4. Open the gripper and release wrench around the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    Grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench.
    Position the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should position the gripper above the peg.
    Open the gripper and release the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should open the gripper and release the wrench around the peg.
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Place the gripper near the wrench and the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the peg, the robot should move the gripper to the area.
2. Position the gripper to grab the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not positioned to grab the wrench, the robot should align the gripper correctly.
3. Close the gripper around the wrench to pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is open and around the wrench, the robot should close the gripper.
4. Move the gripper towards the peg and position it to insert the wrench around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg or the wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should move and align the gripper.
5. Slide the wrench around the peg until it clicks in place.
- When the wrench is not around the peg or the gripper is not holding the wrench securely, the robot should slide the wrench until it clicks in place around the peg.
