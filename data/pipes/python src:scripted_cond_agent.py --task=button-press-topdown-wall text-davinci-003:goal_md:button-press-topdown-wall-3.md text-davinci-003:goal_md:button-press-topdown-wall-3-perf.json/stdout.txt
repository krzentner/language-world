    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the short wall from the left  2. Line the gripper up with the button from the left  3. Push down on the button from the top
    To push the button down from above with the short wall in the way, we need to first put the gripper around the short wall from the left.
    - When robot's gripper is not around short wall and gripper is not vertically aligned with short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around short wall and gripper is closed
    To reach around the wall, the gripper needs to be lowered and closed. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the button
    Now the gripper is in a comfortable position to the right of the button and the wall, so it can be lined up with the button from the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is still around the short wall
    Now that the gripper is lined up from the left, push down on the button from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is around the short wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
