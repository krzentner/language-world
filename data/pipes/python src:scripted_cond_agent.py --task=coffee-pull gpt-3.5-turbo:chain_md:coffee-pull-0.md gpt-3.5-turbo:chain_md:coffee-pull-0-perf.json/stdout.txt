To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Pull mug towards goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not lined up with the mug handle vertically, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    If the gripper is above the mug handle, try to grab it by moving the gripper down around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, the robot should drop gripper around the mug handle.
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can try to pull the mug towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, the robot should pull mug towards goal.
