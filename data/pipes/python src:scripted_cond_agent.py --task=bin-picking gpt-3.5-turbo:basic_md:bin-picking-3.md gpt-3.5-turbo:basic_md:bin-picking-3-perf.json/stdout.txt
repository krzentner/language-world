For the task `bin-picking`, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper has a secure grip on the cube, the robot should lift the cube from the table.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, the robot should move the gripper over the bin.
- When the robot's gripper is above the bin and the gripper is open, the robot should release the cube into the bin.
- When the cube is successfully placed in the bin, the robot should retract its arm away from the bin.
