The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front reliably. To do this, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Align gripper vertically with the button
    We need to line up the robot's gripper vertically with the button first. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, we can move closer to the button and press it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
