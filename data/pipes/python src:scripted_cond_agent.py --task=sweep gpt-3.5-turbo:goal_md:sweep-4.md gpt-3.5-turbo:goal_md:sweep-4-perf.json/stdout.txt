To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move the cube sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube, so we don't bump into it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and closed, we can pick it up and move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper sideways until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
