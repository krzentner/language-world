To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper has a firm grasp on the peg, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is still holding the peg, the robot should release the peg at the target location.
To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should place gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower gripper into the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the peg at the target location.
To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the gripper is open and not around the peg, the robot should drop the gripper around the peg inside the hole.
    - When the gripper is around the peg and the peg is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the gripper is holding the peg out of the hole and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is holding the peg, the robot should place the peg at the target location.

To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole and the peg is still in the hole, the robot should insert the gripper into the hole and grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper has successfully grabbed the peg, the robot should lift the gripper out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the peg at the target location.
