The steps for performing the `button-press-wall` task are as follows:

1. Put gripper above the button 
2. Line up the gripper with the button as viewed from the side 
3. Drop gripper around the button 
4. Push the button down

The code for performing the `button-press-wall` task would then be as follows:

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Line up the gripper with the button as viewed from the side
    #  3. Drop gripper around the button 
    #  4. Push the button down
    # First, put the gripper above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button")
    # If the button is not left of the gripper, move the gripper slightly
    # so the button is left of the gripper.
    if check("the button is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button")
    # If the gripper is near the button but not around it, enclose it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the button, just push it down to press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper left of the button
  2. Push the wall away with the gripper
  3. Line the gripper up with the button
  4. Push down on the button from the front

If the robot's gripper is not left of the button, it should move it there.
We’re working around the wall, so make sure the robot’s gripper is in front of the wall.

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the button
    #  2. Push the wall away with the gripper
    #  3. Line the gripper up with the button
    #  4. Push down on the button from the front
    # If the robot's gripper is not left of the button, it should move it there.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button and in front of the wall")
    # We’re working around the wall, so make sure the robot’s gripper is in front of the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the wall and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up with the button, we can push the button down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper in front of the button
2. Drop gripper slightly above the top of the short wall
3. Push down through the wall to push the button

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of the button
    #  2. Drop gripper slightly above the top of the short wall
    #  3. Push down through the wall to push the button
    # Put the gripper directly in front of the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button")
    # Drop the gripper slightly above the top of the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # Push down through the wall to push the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")


The robot needs to push a button from the front, but the button is blocked by a short wall.

The steps required to complete this task would be:

1. Put gripper forward of the wall at the same level as the button
2. Move gripper towards the wall and lower it to the level of the button
3. Push the button from the side

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of the wall directly above the button
    #  2. Move the gripper towards the wall and lower it to the level of the button
    #  3. Push the button from the side
    # Put the gripper forward of the wall at the same level as the button
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the button")
    # Move the gripper towards the wall and lower it to the level of the button
    if check("the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("towards the wall")
    # Now that the gripper is aligned with the button, close the gripper around
    # it and push it from the side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button", close_gripper=True)
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button")
```


Steps: 
1. Move the gripper to the short wall that is near the button
2. Lower the gripper to the wall in line with the button
3. Push the button from the side of the short wall

Solution:
```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper to the short wall that is near the button
    #  2. Lower the gripper to the wall in line with the button
    #  3. Push the button from the side of the short wall
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the short wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the short wall")
    # If the gripper is near the short wall, lower it to the wall in line with
    # the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in line with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("in line with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is in line with the button (as viewed from the side) we
    # can push the buton by moving the gripper left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in line with the button and the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button")
