To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Move the lid above the box  4. Lower the lid onto the box  5. Release the gripper
    First, put the gripper above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid, the robot should put gripper above the box lid.
    If the gripper is not around the lid, move it down around the lid and tighten the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lid and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the box lid.
    Move the lid above the box and align it with the box.
    - When the box lid is not above the box and the box lid is not horizontally aligned with the box, the robot should align the lid with the box.
    Slowly lower the lid onto the box.
    - When the box lid is above the box and the gripper has a small distance from the box, the robot should lower the lid onto the box.
    Release the gripper and finish the task.
    - When the gripper is holding the lid on the box, the robot should release the gripper.
