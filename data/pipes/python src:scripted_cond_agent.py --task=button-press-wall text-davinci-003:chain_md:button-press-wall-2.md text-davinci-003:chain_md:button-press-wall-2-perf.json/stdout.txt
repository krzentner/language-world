Steps: 
    1. Put gripper right of the button and over the wall 
    2. Push the button from the front 
    3. Push the button harder.

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper right of the button and over the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the button and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should move the gripper right of the button and over the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should push the button from the front.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is in front of the button, the robot should push the button harder.
