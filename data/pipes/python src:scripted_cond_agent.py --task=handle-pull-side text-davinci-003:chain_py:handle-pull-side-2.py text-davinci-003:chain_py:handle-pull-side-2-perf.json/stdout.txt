    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Grab handle
    #  3. Pull up handle

    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):

    # Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab
    # the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
