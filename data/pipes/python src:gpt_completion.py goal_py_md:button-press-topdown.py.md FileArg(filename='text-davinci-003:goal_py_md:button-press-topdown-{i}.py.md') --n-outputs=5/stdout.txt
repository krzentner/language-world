Using model: text-davinci-003


Here's the code:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```


The program should be:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
``


Here is the solution:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
# def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, we need to line up the gripper from above so that it is facing the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button", close_gripper=True)
```


Continue with the following code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper above the button.
    # Because this is a "topdown" action, we just need to line up the gripper
    # from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```


Finish with:

```
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
