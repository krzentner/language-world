Steps:  1. Put gripper above door dial  2. Grab door dial with gripper  3. Spin door dial to the desired number 
    First, put the gripper above the dial on the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door dial, the robot should put gripper above door dial. 
    If the gripper can get around the dial, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around door dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door dial. 
    Once the dial is grabbed, turn it to the desired number.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door dial, the robot should spin door dial to desired number.
