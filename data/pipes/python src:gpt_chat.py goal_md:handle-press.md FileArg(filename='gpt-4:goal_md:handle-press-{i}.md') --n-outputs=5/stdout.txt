To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down on the handle
    The robot should first line up the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, it should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the object being manipulated.
