The code should check if the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and put the gripper above the stick.
Then, it should check if the robot's gripper is not near the stick and grab the stick.
Next, it should check if the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos and line the stick up with the thermos.
Finally, it should check if the stick is near the thermos and pull the thermos to the goal location.

```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos"):
        robot.align("stick with thermos")
    if check("the stick is near the thermos"):
        robot.pull("thermos to goal")
```
