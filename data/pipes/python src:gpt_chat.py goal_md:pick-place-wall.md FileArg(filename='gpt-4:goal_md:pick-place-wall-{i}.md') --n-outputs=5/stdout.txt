To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck up and over the wall to the goal location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, move the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, we can pick it up now.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper up and over the wall to the goal location. We might have to move sideways to avoid the wall as well.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the goal location, move the robot's gripper down to place the puck at the goal location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 
    1. Put the gripper above the puck on the side of the wall
    2. Move the gripper over the wall while lowering it to grab the puck
    3. Lift the gripper and puck over the wall
    4. Move the gripper to the target location while keeping the puck level to avoid dropping it
    5. Lower the gripper to place the puck at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck on the side of the wall, where there is enough space to slide the gripper over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck on the side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until it is above the puck on the side of the wall
    Once the gripper is above the puck, move the gripper over the wall while lowering it to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not over the wall and not holding the puck, move the robot's gripper over the wall while lowering it to grab the puck
    Now that the gripper has picked up the puck, lift the gripper and puck over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the puck and is above the wall, move the robot's gripper until it is on the other side of the wall
    While moving the gripper to the target location, keep the puck level to avoid dropping it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper to the target location while keeping the puck level
    Lastly, lower the gripper to place the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until it is above the target location and lower the gripper to place the puck at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck and close gripper
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, close the gripper to pick up the puck

2. Move the gripper over the wall to the target location
    - When the target location is on the other side of the wall, move the gripper over the wall until the gripper is above the target location
    - If the gripper cannot move over the wall, the robot should find a different path or solution to deliver the object accurately to the target location.

3. Open gripper to drop the puck
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, open the gripper to drop the puck at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck on the side of the wall opposite the target
We need to put the gripper above the puck, and we also need to make sure the gripper is on the side of the wall opposite the target.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the gripper is not on the correct side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the gripper is on the opposite side of the wall from the target.
2. Grab the puck
Once the gripper is above the puck, we should be able to grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
 - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed.
3. Move the gripper to the other side of the wall
Now that we have the puck, we need to move the gripper to the other side of the wall so that we can place it at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not on the other side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is on the other side of the wall opposite the target.
4. Place the puck at the target location
Finally, we can place the puck at the target location by moving the gripper down and releasing the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is opened to release the puck.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck on the other side of the wall, so that the gripper's line of sight to the puck is unobstructed by the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the gripper's line of sight to the puck is obstructed by the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck on the other side of the wall
2. Use the gripper to pick up the puck and hold it securely.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and closed
3. Move the gripper around the wall to the target location while holding the puck securely.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper over the wall and down towards the target location, making sure to keep the puck securely held within the gripper.
4. Release the puck at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the puck is within the gripper, open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
