    Steps:  1. Reach towards the wall  2. Line up the gripper with the top of the wall  3. Reach the gripper over the wall  4. Move the gripper to the target location
    Before actually getting to the target, the gripper needs to get around the wall first. Move the gripper to the wall and put the gripper below the top of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near wall and the robot's gripper is not below top of wall, the robot should put gripper towards wall.
    As long as the gripper is below the top of the wall, move it to the other side.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall and the robot's gripper is below top of the wall, the robot should reach the gripper over wall.
    Once the robot's gripper is over the wall, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location and the robot's gripper is over wall, the robot should move gripper to target location.

Steps:  1. Reach around the wall  2. Reach to goal
If the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move it near the wall in front of the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is not near wall, the robot should reach around wall.
Once the robot's gripper is near the wall, we should be able to reach the goal by moving the gripper to the side.
- When robot's gripper is near wall, the robot should reach to goal.

    Steps:  1. Reach towards side of wall but short of target  2. Move around wall  3. Reach to target
    Because of the wall, we can't reach to the target straight away.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near side of wall but short of target, the robot should reach to side of wall but short of target.
    Once the robot's gripper is near the side of the wall, move to the target side of the wall, but short of the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is near side of wall but short of target, the robot should move around wall.
    Once the robot's gripper is on the target side of the wall, just reach to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is at target side of wall, the robot should reach to target.

    Steps:  1. Reach above the wall 2. Reach around the wall  3. Reach towards the target location 
    First, reach up and above the wall with the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot is not above the wall, the robot should reach above the wall.
    Now that the gripper is above the wall, it's time for the robot to reach around the wall. Move the gripper away from the wall and then back towards it.
    - When the robot is not near the wall, the robot should reach around the wall.
    When the gripper is near the wall, the robot can now reach directly towards the target location.
    - When the robot is not near the target location and the robot is near the wall, the robot should reach towards the target location.


The steps the robot should perform are:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper above target  2. Align gripper with wall  3. Slide gripper around wall  4. Move gripper to target
    First, the robot should move its gripper toward the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target, the robot should move its gripper above the target.
    Once the robot's gripper is near the target, align it with the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the wall, the robot should align gripper with wall.
    Now the robot can slide its gripper around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not to the other side of wall, the robot should slide gripper around wall.
    Finally the robot can reach to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the other side of wall and gripper is not above target, the robot should move gripper to target.
