    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball and close the gripper  3. Line up the ball in front of the hoop  4. Lift arm up and push ball towards the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    Next, if the gripper is not around the ball, put it around the ball and close the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the ball is secure, move the robot's arm up and line up the ball in front of the hoop.
    - When the ball is not horizontally aligned with the hoop, move the robot's arm until the ball is horizontally aligned with the hoop
    To push the ball into the hoop, lift the robot's arm up and push the ball into hoop with the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's arm is raised and the ball is horizontal aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the ball is in the hoop
