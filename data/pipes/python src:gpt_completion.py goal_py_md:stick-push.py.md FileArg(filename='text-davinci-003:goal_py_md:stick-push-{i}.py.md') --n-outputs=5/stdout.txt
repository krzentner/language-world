Steps:
1. Put the gripper below the stick
2. Wrap the gripper around the stick
3. Push the stick until it is close to the thermos
4. Move the stick until the thermos is moved to the target location

Solution:

The goal is to get the thermos to the target location.

Steps:
1. Put gripper near the top of the stick
2. Drop gripper around the stick
3. Move the stick forward so it pushes the thermos to the target
