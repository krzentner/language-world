To hit the nail with the hammer, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the hammer above the nail  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper  3. Line up the hammer with the nail  4. Move the hammer down to hit the nail
    First, put the gripper above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer
    Once the gripper is above the hammer and gripper is closed, line the hammer up with the nail.
    - When the hammer is not horizontally aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail
    Now that the hammer is lined up with the nail, we can hit the nail.
    - When the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is lowered down onto the nail and then lifted up again
