    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube 2. Drop gripper onto cube 3. Lift cube with gripper 4. Move cube to goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    We don't want to accidentally bump the cube, so try to align the gripper with the cube from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper onto cube.
    Once we've dropped the gripper onto the cube, try to lift the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lift cube with gripper.
    We've lifted the cube, so we can move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube to goal.
