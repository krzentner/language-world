Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
It looks like the "pick-place" function was already defined earlier in the code. Did you want me to provide a revised version of it or is it okay as it is?
I'm sorry, but you have already defined the pick_place function earlier in the script. Do you need help with anything else?
It seems like the pick_place function has been duplicated in the code. Here's the corrected code:

# pick-place: pick up an object and hold it at the target location
# def pick_place(robot, object):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above object
    #  2. Drop gripper around object
    #  3. Close gripper around object
    #  4. Move object to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the object, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check(f"the robot's gripper is not above the {object}"):
        robot.place(f"gripper above {object}")
    # If the gripper isn't around the object, put it around the object.
    if check(f"the robot's gripper is not around {object} and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop(f"gripper around {object}")
    # If the gripper is near the object and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check(f"the robot's gripper is near {object} and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close(f"gripper around {object}")
    # We closed the gripper, and the object is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the object to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check(f"the robot's gripper is above {object} and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place(f"{object} at goal")
This function has already been defined above. Is there anything else you need help with?
This function has already been defined above. Do you need any modifications to it?
