To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Lift the mug up  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Lower the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, lift the mug up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not holding the mug, the robot should grab handle and lift mug up.
    Move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and is not near the target location, the robot should move the mug to the target location.
    Finally, lower the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and is holding the mug, the robot should lower the mug to the target location.
