    Steps:  1. Place the robot's gripper above the wall  2. Push the wall to the side  3. Reach the target location using the gripper
    First, place the gripper above the wall and make sure it is in the right spot.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall, the robot should place gripper above wall.
    If the gripper is over the wall, the robot should push the wall aside to open the gap.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wall and gap size between wall and target location is not big enough for gripper, the robot should push wall to side.
    Once the gap size between wall and target location is big enough for the robot's gripper to fit, reach for the target location with the gripper.
    - When gap size between wall and target location is big enough for gripper, the robot should reach for the target location with the gripper.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the left of the wall  2. Push the wall so that the puck is visible  3. Grab the puck and slide it to the target location
    First, move the gripper to the left of the wall, so that it is visible and the puck is clear of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the wall, the robot should put gripper to left of wall.
    Once the gripper is left of the wall, we should be able to see the puck. Now we can push the wall to the right, exposing the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the wall, the robot should push wall right.
    When the wall is pushed enough, we can grab the puck and slide it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the wall and the puck is exposed, the robot should grab puck and slide it to goal.


    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Angle gripper towards the wall  4. Slide the puck towards the wall  5. Push the puck towards target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    If the gripper is not near the puck, move it down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should the close gripper around the puck.
    Angle the gripper in such a way that the wall will be in the way when the gripper slides the puck.
    - When the gripper is above the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should angle gripper towards wall.
    Slide the puck towards the wall, pushing it slightly against the wall.
    - When the puck is near the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide puck towards wall.
    Now push the puck towards the target location
    - When the puck is parallel to the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push puck towards target location.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Move the gripper left until it is against the wall  3. Push the puck towards the goal
    We want to push the puck to the target location, but there's a wall in the way, so the first step is to move the gripper to the side and make sure it is against the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not against wall and the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should move the gripper to the left and against the wall.
    When the gripper is against the wall and in the same position as the puck, the wall should also prevent the puck from moving away; at this point, we can push the puck to the goal. 
    - When the robot's gripper is against the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should push the puck towards goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind the wall, aligned with the puck  2. Push the wall to the side
    If the robot's gripper is behind the wall, align it with the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind wall and the puck is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should put gripper behind wall.
    If the gripper is lined up with the puck, push the wall to the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind wall and the puck is forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should push wall aside.
