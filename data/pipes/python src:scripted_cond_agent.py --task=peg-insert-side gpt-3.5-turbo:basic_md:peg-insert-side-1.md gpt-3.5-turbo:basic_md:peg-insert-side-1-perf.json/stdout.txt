To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform these steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should move the gripper above and near the peg.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left of the peg and lower it to the correct height for insertion.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should move the gripper slightly to align the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should move the gripper closer to the hole and insert the peg.
- After peg insertion, the robot should release the gripper and move it away from the peg and hole.
