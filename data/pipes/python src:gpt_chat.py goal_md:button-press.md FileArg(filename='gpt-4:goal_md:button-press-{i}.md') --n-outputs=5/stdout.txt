The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front. To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the front  2. Push the button
    Since this is not a `topdown` task, we need to line up the robot's gripper from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button
    Once the robot's gripper is aligned with the button from the front, we can simply push the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the button to push it.
The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front.
To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button 2. Move the gripper towards button until the gripper is horizontally aligned with the button 3. Push the button
First, put the gripper in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button
If the gripper is in front of the button, move it towards the button until it's aligned horizontally.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the button but not horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button
Finally, push the button.
    - Push the button.
The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front.
To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push the button
    Because this is not "topdown", we just need to put the gripper in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up in front of the button, just push the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button.
For the `button-press` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of button  2. Close the gripper around button  3. Push the button
    First, put the gripper in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is closed around the button, just push it to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing against the button
The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front reliably. To do this, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Align gripper vertically with the button
    We need to line up the robot's gripper vertically with the button first. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, we can move closer to the button and press it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
