Note: the `check()` function in this code is referring to a hypothetical helper function that checks if a certain condition is true, like if the robot's gripper is in the correct position to perform the next action. The actual implementation of `check()` is not shown here. The robot's `move()`, `grab()`, `twist()`, and `release()` functions are also hypothetical and would need to be implemented based on the specifics of the robot being used.
