To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper into plate to trap it  3. Slide plate back to goal
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
If the gripper is not trapped around the plate, push it towards the plate to trap it.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the gripper is not horizontally aligned with the plate, the robot should push gripper into plate to trap it.
Once the gripper is trapped around the plate, slide the plate back to the goal location.
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the goal and the gripper is trapped around the plate, the robot should slide plate back to goal.
