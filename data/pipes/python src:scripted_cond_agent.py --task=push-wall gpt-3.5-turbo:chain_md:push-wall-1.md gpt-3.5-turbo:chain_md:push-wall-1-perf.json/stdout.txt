To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Move gripper to the side of the wall  4. Slide the puck to the target

First, put the gripper above the puck as in the `push` task.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.

Next, push the gripper into the top of the puck as in the `push` task.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.

Then, move the gripper to the side of the wall to avoid it.
- When the wall is blocking the way to the target, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the wall.

Finally, slide the puck to the target location as in the `push` task.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
