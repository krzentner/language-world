To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper above the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, the robot should grab hold of the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle left to open the faucet.
- When the desired amount of water is flowing, the robot should turn the handle back to the original position to close the faucet.
