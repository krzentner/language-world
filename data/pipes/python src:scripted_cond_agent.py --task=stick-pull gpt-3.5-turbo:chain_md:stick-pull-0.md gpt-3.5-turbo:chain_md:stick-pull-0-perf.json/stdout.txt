Here are the steps the robot should perform for the `stick-pull` task:

1. Put the gripper near the top of the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the top of the stick.
2. Close the gripper around the stick to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is near the top of the stick and open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick to grab it.
3. Put the gripper near the thermos handle.
- When the gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the thermos handle.
4. Use the stick to hook onto the thermos handle.
- When the gripper is near the thermos handle, the robot should use the stick-like a hook to grab onto the thermos handle.
5. Pull the thermos towards the target location, using the stick.
- When the stick is hooked onto the thermos handle, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location.
6. Release the gripper to let go of the stick.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the gripper to let go of the stick.
