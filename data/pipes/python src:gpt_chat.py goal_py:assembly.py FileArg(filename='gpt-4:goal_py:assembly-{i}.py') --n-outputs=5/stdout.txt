# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench and roughly around peg
    #  2. Drop gripper around wrench
    #  3. Rotate wrench around peg until it clicks into place
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the wrench and around the peg.

    #   1. Rotating the wrist to be horizontally aligned with the peg.
    #   2. Adjusting the position of the gripper so that the wrench is very
    #      near or touching the peg.
    #   3. Closing the gripper a little bit to press the wrench onto the peg.
    #   4. Compressing the gripper all the way to cause the wrench to click into
    #      place around the peg.

# Steps:
