- Steps:
    1. Put gripper above block
    2. Drop gripper around block
    3. Close gripper around block
    4. Move block to target location
    5. Place block on the shelf

- If the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the gripper above the block.
    ```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.place("gripper above block")
    ```
- Once the gripper is in position, drop the gripper around the block.
    ```
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around block")
    ```
- If the gripper is near the block and open, close the gripper around it.
    ```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the block and open"):
        robot.close("gripper around block")
    ```
- Once the block is grasped, move it to the target location.
    ```
    if check("the robot's grip is closed around the block"):
        robot.move("block to target location")
    ```
- Lastly, place the block on the shelf.
    ```
    if check("the block is at the target location"):
        robot.place("block on shelf")
    ```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above block
2. Drop gripper around block
3. Close gripper around block
4. Move block to goal

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
    robot.place("gripper above block")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around block")
if check("the robot's gripper is near block and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around block")
if check("the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.place("block at goal")


Here's the code:
```
# shelf-place: pick up the block and place it at the target location
# def shelf_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above block
    #  2. Drop gripper around block
    #  3. Close gripper around block
    #  4. Move block to target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't knock it
    # over while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.place("gripper above block")
    # If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around block") 
    # If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around block")
    # We closed the gripper, and the block is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the block to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("block at goal")
```


Steps:
  1. Put the gripper slightly above the block
  2. Drop the gripper around the block
  3. Close the gripper around the block
  4. Move the block to the target shelf
  5. Place the block on the shelf

# shelf-place: pick up the block and place it at the target location
# def shelf_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper slightly above the block
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with block"):
        robot.put("gripper slightly above block")
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the block
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around the block")
    #  3. Close the gripper around the block
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around block")
    #  4. Move the block to the target shelf
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("block to goal")
    #  5. Place the block on the shelf
    if check("block is near goal shelf"):
        robot.place("block on shelf")

    # Now that the block is above the shelf, try to release it onto the shelf. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the shelf and the block is left of the gripper"):
        robot.release("block onto shelf")
