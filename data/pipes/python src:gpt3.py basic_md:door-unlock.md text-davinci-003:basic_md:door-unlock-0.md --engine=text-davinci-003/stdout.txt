The robot should perform the following steps to turn the dial on the door reliably: 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, the robot should move gripper above dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should turn dial clockwise or counterclockwise.
