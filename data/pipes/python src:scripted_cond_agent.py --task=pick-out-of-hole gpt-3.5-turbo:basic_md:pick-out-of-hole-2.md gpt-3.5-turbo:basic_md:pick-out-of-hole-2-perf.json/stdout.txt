To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the gripper is open and not around the peg, the robot should drop the gripper around the peg inside the hole.
    - When the gripper is around the peg and the peg is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the gripper is holding the peg out of the hole and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is holding the peg, the robot should place the peg at the target location.
