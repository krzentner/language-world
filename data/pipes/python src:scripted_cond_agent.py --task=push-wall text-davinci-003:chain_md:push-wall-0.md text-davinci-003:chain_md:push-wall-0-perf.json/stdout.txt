    Steps:  1. Place the robot's gripper above the wall  2. Push the wall to the side  3. Reach the target location using the gripper
    First, place the gripper above the wall and make sure it is in the right spot.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wall, the robot should place gripper above wall.
    If the gripper is over the wall, the robot should push the wall aside to open the gap.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wall and gap size between wall and target location is not big enough for gripper, the robot should push wall to side.
    Once the gap size between wall and target location is big enough for the robot's gripper to fit, reach for the target location with the gripper.
    - When gap size between wall and target location is big enough for gripper, the robot should reach for the target location with the gripper.
