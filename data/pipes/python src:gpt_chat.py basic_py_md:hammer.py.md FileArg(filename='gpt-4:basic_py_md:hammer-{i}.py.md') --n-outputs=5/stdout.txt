# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    if check("the hammer is not in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("hammer")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the nail"):
        robot.put("gripper above nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the nail and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the nail"):
        robot.rotate("gripper to align with nail")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the nail"):
        robot.hit("the nail with the hammer")
Here's a program to perform `hammer` task:

```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    if check("the hammer is not near the nail"):
        robot.reach("to the hammer")
        robot.grab("the hammer")
        robot.reach("to the nail")
    robot.swing("the hammer")
    robot.release("the hammer")
```

Explanation:
- First, we check if the hammer is not near the nail. If so, we reach for the hammer, grab it, and then reach for the nail.
- Next, we swing the hammer towards the nail to hit it.
- Finally, we release the hammer to let it go back to its original position.
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
if check("the hammer is not held in the robot's gripper"):
    robot.grab("the hammer")
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the nail"):
    robot.move("the gripper above the nail")
if check("the hammer is not aligned with the nail"):
    robot.align("the hammer with the nail")
if check("the hammer is not hitting the nail"):
    robot.push("the hammer onto the nail")
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer and the hammer is not close to the nail"):
    robot.move("gripper above the hammer")
    robot.grab("the hammer")
    robot.move("gripper above the nail")
if check("the hammer is above the nail and the robot's gripper is holding the hammer"):
    robot.push("hammer to hit the nail")
    robot.move("gripper away from the nail and the hammer")
    robot.drop("the hammer")
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
if check("the hammer is not in the robot's gripper"):
    robot.grab("the hammer")
if check("the hammer is in the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the nail"):
    robot.reach("the nail")
if check("the nail is in front of the robot's gripper and the hammer is above the nail"):
    robot.push("the hammer down onto the nail")
