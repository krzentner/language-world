Steps:  1. Put gripper over the wall  2. Drop gripper below the wall  3. Move gripper to above puck   4. Drop gripper around puck  5. Close gripper around puck  6. Move puck to goal
The robot should first put the gripper over the wall, so that it won't obstruct the path of the gripper to the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should put gripper above wall.
Once the gripper is above the wall, it should move the gripper below the wall, in order to move to the puck without being obstructed by the wall in front.
- When the robot's gripper is not below wall, the robot should move gripper below wall.
After the gripper is below the wall, it should go to the puck and drop the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper above puck.
Once the gripper is around the puck, close the gripper to trap the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
Finally, move the puck to the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to goal.
