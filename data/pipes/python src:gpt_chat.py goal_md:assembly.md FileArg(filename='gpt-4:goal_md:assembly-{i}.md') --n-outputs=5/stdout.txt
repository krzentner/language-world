To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab wrench with gripper  3. Align wrench with peg  4. Drop wrench around peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    After that, the robot should grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not holding the wrench and the robot's gripper is above the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench
    Once the robot has the wrench, it should align the wrench with the peg.
    - When the wrench and the peg are not horizontally aligned, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg
    Finally, the robot should drop the wrench around the peg.
    - When the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg and the gripper is not holding the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is closed around the peg
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench and peg, with wrench close to the peg  2. Slide wrench down around peg  3. Close gripper around wrench  4. Lift wrench with peg attached
    First, put the gripper above the wrench and the peg, with the wrench close to the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not roughly above the wrench and the peg, move the robot's gripper until it is
    Once above the wrench and the peg, slide the wrench down around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the wrench, move the robot's gripper until it is around the peg and the wrench
    Close the gripper around the wrench once it's around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the wrench but not close, close the gripper
    Finally, lift the wrench with the peg attached.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and around the wrench and the peg, move the robot's gripper until it is above the desired location and then open the gripper to drop the peg.
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the wrench  2. Open gripper and drop the wrench around the peg  3. Close gripper to ensure wrench is snug
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Then, drop the gripper around the peg and ensure that the gripper is closed and the wrench is snug around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, close the gripper around the peg to ensure the wrench is snug.
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper roughly above the wrench and peg  2. Open the gripper and drop the wrench onto the peg  3. Close the gripper around the peg and wrench to tighten the grip
    First, put the gripper roughly above both the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench and peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and peg
    Open the gripper and drop the wrench onto the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and peg and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and peg, open the robot's gripper and move it down to drop the wrench onto the peg
    Close the gripper around the peg and wrench to tighten the grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and peg, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is tightly closed around the wrench and peg
To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Put gripper above the peg  4. Lower the wrench until it surrounds the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Then, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Finally, lower the wrench until it surrounds the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the wrench is not surrounding the peg, move the robot's gripper until the wrench surrounds the peg
