Here's the completed code for the `pick-place-wall` function:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        # raise the gripper over the wall
        robot.move("gripper up")
        robot.move("gripper right")
        robot.move("gripper right")
        robot.move("gripper down")
        robot.move("gripper down")
        # move the gripper to the goal location
        robot.move("gripper right")
        robot.move("gripper up")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
```

In this function, we first perform the same checks as in the `pick-place` function. Then, we add some additional steps to raise the gripper over the wall and move it to the goal location. We do this by calling the `move` method on the robot object with the appropriate arguments to move the gripper up, right, left, and down. Finally, we call the `place` method to place the puck at the goal location.
