    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of dial  2. Turn dial until it reaches the target angle  3. Release the dial
    First, put the gripper on top of the dial so that we can control the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is near the dial and closed, we can start turning the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the dial is at the target angle
    If the dial has reached the target angle, just release the dial to finish.
    - When the dial is at the target angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is not near the dial
