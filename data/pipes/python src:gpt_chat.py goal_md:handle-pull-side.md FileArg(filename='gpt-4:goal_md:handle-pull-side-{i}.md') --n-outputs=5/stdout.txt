To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Lift the handle upwards
    First, put the gripper around the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, lift the handle upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper upwards until the handle is lifted to the desired height.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around handle  2. Grip handle  3. Pull handle up from the side
    We need to put the gripper around the handle before we can lift it up. Move the gripper to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open
    Once the gripper is near the handle and open, position the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is not in the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the handle is in the gripper, we can lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is off to the side of the handle enough to lift it up keeping the gripper stable
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle upwards while keeping the gripper closed
    First, put the gripper near the handle. We don't need to be precise about the position.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    Once the gripper is near the handle, grab the handle with the gripper and close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not closed, close the robot's gripper
    Now that the gripper is holding the handle, pull it upwards to lift the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is in the desired position
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Lift the handle up
    First, move the robot's gripper so that it is around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the handle and then close the gripper around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is lifted up to the desired height.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper next to the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper next to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is aligned with the handle, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed around the handle
    With the gripper closed around the handle, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is in the raised position
