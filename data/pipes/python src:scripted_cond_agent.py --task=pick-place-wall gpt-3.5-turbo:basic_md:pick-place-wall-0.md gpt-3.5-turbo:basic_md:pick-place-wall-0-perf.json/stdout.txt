To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and there is a wall in between, the robot should move gripper to the side of target location while keeping the puck in hand.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location without any obstructions, the robot should move gripper over target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above target location, the robot should lower the puck to the target location.
