    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Wrap the gripper around the handle  3. Pull up the handle
    We need to put the robot's gripper near the handle, so that it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should put gripper near handle.
    As long as the gripper is near the handle, we can grab it by closing the gripper if it isn't already.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is closed, pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull up handle.
