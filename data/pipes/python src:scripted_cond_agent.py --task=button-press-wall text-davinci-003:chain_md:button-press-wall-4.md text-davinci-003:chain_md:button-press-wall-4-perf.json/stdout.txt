    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the button  2. Lift the wall with the gripper  3. Push down on the button from the front
    We need to move the gripper above the button so that we can grab the wall and lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
    Now that the gripper is above the button, we can grab the wall by closing the gripper and lifting it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is not lifted from its bottom, the robot should lift wall from its bottom.
    Now that the wall is lifted, we can push down on the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is lifted, the robot should push down on button.
