    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper  3. Turn the faucet right 
    First, put the gripper over the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with faucet handle, the robot should put gripper over faucet handle.
    We should be able to grab the faucet handle once the robot's gripper is almost lined up with it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, the robot should put gripper around faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the faucet handle to the right to close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle, the robot should turn faucet right.
