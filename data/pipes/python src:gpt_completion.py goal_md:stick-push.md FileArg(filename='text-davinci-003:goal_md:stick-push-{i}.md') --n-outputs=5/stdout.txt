    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Hold the stick  4. Push the thermos with the stick
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    After the gripper is above the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper is around the stick, we can hold the stick by moving the gripper away from the thermos, while keeping it against the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is far enough away from the thermos that it has a good grip on the stick
    Now that the robot's gripper has a good grip on the stick, we can push the thermos until it reaches the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is far enough away from the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the thermos is at the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Close gripper around the stick  3. Move gripper so it is forward aligned with the thermos  4. Push thermos towards target location
    First, we need to put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    If the robot's gripper is above the stick, close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is closed and it is near the thermos, move the stick so it is forward aligned with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the stick is not forward aligned with the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is forward aligned with the thermos
    Finally, use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the target location

    Steps: 1. Pick up the stick with the gripper  2. Put stick ahead of the thermos  3. Drag the stick towards the target location  4. Push the stick against the thermos 
    First, pick up the stick with gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the stick is not ahead of the thermos, move the stick ahead of the thermos
    - When the stick is not ahead of the thermos and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the stick is ahead of the thermos
    Now that the stick is in the right place, drag it towards the target location.
    - When the stick is ahead of thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the target location
    When the stick is lined up between the thermos and the target location, push the stick against the thermos.
    - When the stick is ahead of the thermos and the stick is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the stick is pushing the thermos towards the target location

    Steps:  1. Line up the stick with the edge of the thermos  2. Push the stick along the edge of the thermos  3. Push the thermos to the target location
    First, line up the stick with the edge of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not left of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the left edge of the thermos
    Once the stick is lined up, it should be ready to push the thermos.
    - When the stick is forward aligned with thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Now, we can use the stick to push the thermos by slowly moving it along the edge.
    - When the stick is left of the robot's grip and the thermos is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the thermos is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put the stick in the robot's gripper  2. Put the tip of the stick onto the thermos  3. Push the thermos to the target location
    First, put the stick into the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now the with the stick in the gripper, we want to put the tip of the stick onto the thermos.
    - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos
    Once the tip of the stick is touching the thermos, we can move the stick and push the thermos.
    - When the stick is touching the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
