Next, the steps: 

1. Put the gripper above the dial
2. Drop the gripper around the dial
3. Turn the dial clockwise to lock the door

Assuming the correct code is written for the `check()` function: 

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial clockwise to lock the door
    # Put the gripper near the dial 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above the dial")
    # If the gripper is lined up above the dial, we can grab the dial by moving
    # the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the dial")
    # Once the gripper is around the dial, turn it clockwise to lock the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
        robot.turn("clockwise")
```


The steps for this task are as follows:
1. Put the gripper above the door lock
2. Drop the gripper around the door lock
3. Turn the door lock with the gripper

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door lock
    #  2. Drop gripper around door lock
    #  3. Turn the door lock with the gripper 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the door lock"):
        robot.put("gripper above door lock")
    # As long as the gripper is above, but not around the door lock, put it around the door lock
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the door lock and the robot's gripper is not around the door lock"): 
        robot.drop("gripper around door lock")
    # If the gripper is around the door lock, try to turn it with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door lock"):
        robot.turn("door lock clockwise with gripper")
```


Here's the program:

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the dial
    #  2. Place gripper on the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial to lock or unlock the door
    # First, put the gripper near the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the dial"):
        robot.move("gripper near the dial")
    # Once the gripper is near the dial, put the gripper on the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the dial"):
        robot.grab("the dial")
    # Once the gripper is on the dial, turn the dial to lock/unlock the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is on the dial"):
        robot.turn("dial to lock or unlock door")
``


The program will be: 
``` 
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
#def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around dial
    #  3. Turn dial to the desired position
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the dial, we should be able to
    # grab the dial by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around dial")
    # Once the gripper is around the dial, turn dial to the desired position.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around dial"):
        robot.turn("dial to desired position")
```


The robot should turn the dial on the door in order to lock it.

# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps: 
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial to the left
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the dial. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    # Move the gripper around the dial so that it can properly grip the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around dial"):
        robot.drop("gripper around dial")
    # Finally, turn the dial to the left to lock it in place.    
    if check("the robot's gripper is around dial"):
         robot.turn("dial left")
