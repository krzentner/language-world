Using model: text-davinci-003


The robotic arm needs to reach the target location, but there is a short wall in the way.

Steps:

1. Put gripper above wall
2. Reach over wall to target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
    robot.put("gripper above wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
    robot.reach("over wall to target location")


The robot needs to reach the target location, which is blocked by a short wall.

Steps:
1. Reach towards the target location, until the wall is detected. 
2. Move the gripper around the wall, to the other side. 
3. Reach towards the target location, until it is reached.

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target location, until the wall is detected.
    if check("the target is not reached and the wall is not detected"):
        robot.reach("to target location")
    #  2. Move the gripper around the wall, to the other side.
    if check("the target is not reached and the wall is detected"):
        robot.move("gripper around wall")
    #  3. Reach towards the target location, until it is reached.
    if check("the wall is not detected and the target is not reached"):
        robot.reach("to target location")
```


Then,

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach up above the wall
    #  2. Reach around the wall to the desired target
    # If the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move it up above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.reach("above the wall")
    # Try to reach around the wall to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.reach("around the wall to goal")
```


The robot should then reach the target location with a short wall in the way.

Steps: 
1. Put Gripper Left of the wall
2. Reach over wall towards target location
3. Push against wall to line up the robot's gripper with the wall
4. Reach towards target location

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the wall
    #  2. Reach over wall towards target location
    #  3. Push against wall to line up the robot's gripper with the wall
    #  4. Reach towards target location
    # Put the gripper left of the wall
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper left of wall")
    # Reach over the wall towards the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the wall"):
        robot.reach("over wall to target")
    # Push against the wall to line up the gripper with it. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not aligned with the wall"):
        robot.push("against wall")
    # Once the gripper is aligned with the wall, we can reach towards the 
    # target again.
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the wall"): 
        robot.reach("towards target")
``


The program would look like this:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach near wall in line with the target
    #  2. Move arm up so the gripper is above the wall
    #  3. Reach towards the target
    # Move the gripper near the wall, in line with the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall in line with the target"):
        robot.reach("near wall in line with the target")
    # Move the arm up so the gripper is above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move("arm up above the wall")
    # Finally, reach to the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
```
