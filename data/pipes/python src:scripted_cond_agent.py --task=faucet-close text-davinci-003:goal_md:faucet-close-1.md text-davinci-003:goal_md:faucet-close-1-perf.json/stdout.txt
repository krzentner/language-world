    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the faucet handle  2. Turn the faucet handle right  3. Push the faucet handle further
    The robot needs to be aligned to the faucet handle from the side in order to turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle
    With the gripper vertically aligned with the handle, start turning the handle right.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the faucet handle
    Once the robot's gripper is right of the handle, prompt the robot to push further in order to close the faucet.
    - When the faucet handle is not fully closed, move the robot's gripper until the faucet handle is fully closed.
