Steps:
1. Put gripper above handle
2. Drop gripper around handle
3. Close gripper around handle 
4. Push down on handle

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Close gripper around handle
    #  4. Push down on handle
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the handle")
    # If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the handle and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the handle is trapped by the robot's gripper, we can move the
    # gripper downwards and push the handle down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the handle")


Steps:
1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
2. Push down on the handle from the top

First, put the gripper above the handle.
if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the handle", close_gripper=True)

Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the handle")


Then insert the following code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Push down on the handle
    # First, put the gripper roughly above handle, so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the handle")
    # If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the handle and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
    # Once the gripper has a good grip on the handle, we can just push down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("down")
```


1. Put gripper as viewed from above the handle
2. Push down on the handle

if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the handle", close_gripper=True)

if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("downward alignment with the handle")


Steps:
1. Put gripper above handle
2. Drop gripper around handle
3. Push down on handle

    # Once the gripper is around the handle, push the handle down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("downwards on the handle")
```
