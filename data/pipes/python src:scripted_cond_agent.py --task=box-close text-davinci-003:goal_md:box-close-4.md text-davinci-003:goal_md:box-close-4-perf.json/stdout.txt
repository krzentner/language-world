    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the box lid  2. Drop the gripper around the box lid  3. Close the gripper around the box lid  4. Lift the lid up and place it on the box
    First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid, so that we don't accidentally move the lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    Once the robot's gripper is above the box lid, we should be able to grab it by putting the gripper around it and closing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the lid is secure in the gripper, we can lift the lid up and place it on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is over the box
