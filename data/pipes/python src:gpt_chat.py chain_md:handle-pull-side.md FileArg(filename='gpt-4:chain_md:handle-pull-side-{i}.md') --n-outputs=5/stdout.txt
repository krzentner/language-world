To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle up from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
    If the handle becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the handle. Because the handle is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When handle is not left of the robot's gripper and handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the handle and the handle isn't pulled up from the side, pull the handle up from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not pulled up from the side, the robot should pull the handle up from the side.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle up from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can pull the handle up from the side using a pulling motion.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull handle up from the side.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around handle  2. Pull handle up
    First, put the gripper around the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should move gripper to side of handle and close gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull handle up.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

  Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle up from the side
  First, put the gripper around the handle.
  - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
  If the gripper is fully around the handle, pull up on the handle from the side.
  - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull handle up from the side.
To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Move gripper to one side of the handle  3. Grab the handle with the gripper  4. Pull up on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Move the gripper to one side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not near the side of the handle, the robot should move gripper to one side of the handle.
    Grab the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    Finally, pull up on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull handle up from the side.
