    Steps:  1. Place gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper behind the puck, so that we don't push it away from us when trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should place gripper behind puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper behind puck.
    Once the gripper is behind the puck, we can just push back to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck and the robot's gripper is open the robot should push back on puck.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck 2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    We need to put the gripper behind the puck before we can grab it, because the puck is so small.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should put gripper behind puck.
    Once the gripper is lined up behind the puck, we should be able to grab the puck by moving the gripper up into it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck, the robot should push gripper into back of puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck, we can just slide the puck backwards to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should slide puck to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing into its back and moving the gripper. First, move the gripper so that it is behind the puck.     
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should put the gripper behind the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper up to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.


    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Push down the gripper to trap the puck  3. Slide the puck backwards to the target location 
    We need to put the gripper above the puck before we can push it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is roughly above the puck, try to trap the puck by pushing down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should push the gripper onto the puck.
    If the gripper is around the puck, we can slide it backwards by moving the gripper backwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the target location.


Steps: 1. Put the gripper in front of the puck  2. Push against the front of the puck in the opposite direction of desired movement  3. Push the puck backwards  4. Slide the puck into desired position
- When the robot's gripper is not in front of the puck, the robot should put the gripper in front of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the puck, the robot should push against the front of the puck in the opposite direction of desired movement.
- When the robot is pushing against the front of the puck, the robot should push the puck backwards.
- When the robot's gripper is pushing the puck backwards, the robot should slide the puck into desired position.
