    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Close gripper around stick  3. Put stick near thermos  4. Pull stick to move the thermos to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the stick, we should move the stick near the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos
    Finally, pull the stick to move the thermos to the target location.
    - When the stick is near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
