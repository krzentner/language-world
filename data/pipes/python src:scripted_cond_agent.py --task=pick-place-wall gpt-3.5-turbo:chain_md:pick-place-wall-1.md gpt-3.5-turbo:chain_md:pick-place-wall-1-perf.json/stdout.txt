To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move gripper to wall and place puck over the wall at target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot, the robot should place gripper above puck on the same side of the wall.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, we probably have the puck. Move the gripper over the wall to place the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is closed, the robot should move gripper over the wall and place puck at target location.
