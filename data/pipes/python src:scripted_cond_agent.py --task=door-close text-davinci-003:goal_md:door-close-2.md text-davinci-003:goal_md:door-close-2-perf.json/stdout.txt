    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the door handle  2. Start pushing against the door handle to close the door  3. Push the door closed harder  4. Move the door to the target location
    First, put the gripper left of the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the door handle 
    If the gripper is right of the door handle, we can start pushing the door closed by moving it left.
    - When the door handle is right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the door handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the door isn't close enough to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the door is close enough to the target location
