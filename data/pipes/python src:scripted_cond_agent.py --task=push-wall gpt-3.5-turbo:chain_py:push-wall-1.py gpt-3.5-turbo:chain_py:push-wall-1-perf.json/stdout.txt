# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide puck towards the wall
    #  4. Push against the wall to move the puck around it
    #  5. Slide the puck to the goal
    # We can follow the same steps as the regular push function, with the
    # additional step of pushing against the wall to move the puck around it.
    # If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the puck.

    # down to the puck to slide it.

    # around it.
