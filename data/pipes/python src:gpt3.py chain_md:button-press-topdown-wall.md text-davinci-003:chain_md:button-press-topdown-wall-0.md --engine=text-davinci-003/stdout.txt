    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top

    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move the gripper near the wall.
    If the robot's gripper is near the wall and not vertically aligned with the button, move the gripper to line up with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.
