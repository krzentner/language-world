To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever handle, the robot should put gripper above lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the lever handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, the robot should pull the lever handle up.
To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever handle, the robot should put the gripper above the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever handle, the robot should grab the lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the lever handle, the robot should rotate the lever up.
To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the lever, the robot should move gripper above lever.
- When the robot's gripper is above the lever, the robot should grasp the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is grasping the lever, the robot should pull upwards on the lever to rotate it up.
To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should put gripper above the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, the robot should open the gripper.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the lever and the lever is not already pulled up, the robot should rotate the gripper up to pull the lever.
To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not around the lever and the robot's gripper is near the lever, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is not above the lever, the robot should lift the gripper above the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is above the lever, the robot should pull the lever up.
