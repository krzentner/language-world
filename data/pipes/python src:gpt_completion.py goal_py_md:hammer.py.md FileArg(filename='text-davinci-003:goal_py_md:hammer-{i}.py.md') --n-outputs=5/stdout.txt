Steps:
1. Put gripper above the hammer handle
2. Drop gripper around hammer handle
3. Put gripper above the nail 
4. Swing the hammer to hit the nail

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer handle, we should move the gripper near the hammer handle to start swinging it.

The steps for this task are: 
1. Put the gripper above the hammer handle
2. Drop the gripper around the hammer handle
3. Close the gripper around the hammer handle
4. Swing the hammer to hit the nail

```

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hammer handle

    #  4. Swing hammer to hit nail 
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the hammer handle, so that we don't
    # bump it while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hammer handle"):

    # hit the nail.

# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the hammer
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the handle of the hammer
    #  3. Move the hammer towards the nail
    #  4. Hammer the nail into place
    # First, move the gripper to a place above the hammer to get ready to grab 
    # it.

    # Finally, move the hammer down quickly to hammer  the nail into place.
    if check("the hammer is near the nail"):
        robot.move_gripper("down on the nail")


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the head of the hammer
2. Drop the gripper around the head of the hammer
3. Close the gripper around the head of the hammer
4. Line up the hammer with the nail
5. Swing the hammer down onto the nail

If the robot's gripper isn't above the head of the hammer, move it above the hammer.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the head of the hammer"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the head of the hammer")
```

If the gripper isn't around the head of the hammer and is open, close the gripper around the hammer.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the head of the hammer and the gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the head of the hammer", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is around the hammer, line up the hammer with the nail.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the head of the hammer"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the nail")
```

Once the hammer is lined up with the nail, the robot can swing the hammer down onto the nail.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the nail"):
    robot.move_gripper("below the nail", close_gripper=False)
```


The following steps should be included:

1. Put the gripper above the hammer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the hammer handle.
3. Apply force to the hammer handle by pushing the gripper against the nail. 
4. Close the gripper, ensuring a secure grip on the hammer handle. 
5. Pull the gripper away, guiding the hammer towards the nail head. 
6. Strike the nail by driving the hammer towards it with a firm grip.
