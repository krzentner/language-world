To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the target location sideways while keeping the gripper in contact with the plate.
