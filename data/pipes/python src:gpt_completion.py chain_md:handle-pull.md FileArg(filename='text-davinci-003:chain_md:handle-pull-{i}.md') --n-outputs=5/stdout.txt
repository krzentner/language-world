    - When the robot's gripper is not underneath handle, the robot should put gripper beneath handle.
    Once the gripper is underneath the handle, try to lift up the gripper to lift the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is underneath handle, the robot should raise gripper to lift handle up.
    Once the handle is above the frame, try to pull up the handle.

    First, the robot should put its gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle and the robot's gripper is not below the handle, the robot should put gripper below handle.
    Once the robot's gripper is below the handle, close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is below handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around handle.
    Now that the gripper is closed around the handle, the robot can pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is below handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull handle up.
