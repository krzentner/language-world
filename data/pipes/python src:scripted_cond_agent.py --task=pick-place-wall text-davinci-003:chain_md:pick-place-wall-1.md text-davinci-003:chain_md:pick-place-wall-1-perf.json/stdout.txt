    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Reach over wall to grab puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    Since there's a wall in the way, we need to put the gripper farther away from the puck â€” maybe to the side or above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Then, the robot should reach around the wall to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is on side of puck, the robot should reach over wall to grab puck.
    Once the robot has the puck, just close the gripper to make sure it keeps a hold on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    Lastly, move the puck to its desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.
