    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab cube between two fingers  3. Move cube to goal
    We should move the gripper above the cube before grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, we should open it wide enough to grab the cube between two fingers.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not hovering near cube, the robot should grab cube between two fingers.
    If the gripper is in contact with the cube, it's probably grabbing it, so move to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is hovering near cube, the robot should move cube to goal.
