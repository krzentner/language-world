    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Push the stick towards the thermos  4. Push the thermos towards the target location
    We need to put the gripper above the stick before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the stick is below the gripper, grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab stick.
    Now that we've grabbed the stick, we can push it towards the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should push stick towards thermos.
    If the stick is near the thermos, try to push the thermos to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push thermos towards goal.
