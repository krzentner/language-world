To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the wrench peg.
2. Grab the wrench with the gripper.
3. Lift the wrench straight up off the peg.
4. Move the wrench to the desired location.
To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Position the gripper above the wrench on the peg
            2. Close the gripper around the wrench
            3. Lift the wrench off the peg
    First, position the gripper above the wrench on the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench on the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench on the peg
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench on the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wrench on the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the wrench, we can lift it off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper up until the wrench is lifted off the peg
To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench, grab the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, lift the wrench off the peg and move it to the desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is open
To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper next to the handle of the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench up and away from the peg
    First, put the gripper next to the handle of the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is next to the wrench, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is next to the handle of the wrench and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    After grabbing the wrench, lift it up and away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is still on the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper lifts the wrench up and away from the peg
To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Move the gripper horizontally away from the peg while pulling the wrench vertically up  4. Release the wrench from the gripper
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is aligned with the wrench, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    To pull the wrench off the peg, we need to move the gripper horizontally away from the peg while pulling the wrench vertically up.
    - While the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, move the robot's gripper horizontally away from the peg while pulling the wrench vertically up
    Once the wrench is free from the peg, release it from the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, release the wrench from the gripper.
