To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper has a firm grasp on the peg, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is still holding the peg, the robot should release the peg at the target location.
