    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Grab block with gripper  3. Move block to target location  4. Release block and leave it at target location
    First, put the gripper above the block so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should move the gripper above the block.
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around block.
    Once we've grabbed the block, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the block, the robot should move block to target location.
    When we reach the target location, open the gripper and leave the block at the target location.
    - When block is near the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should release block and leave it at target location.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Grab block with gripper  3. Move block to goal position  4. Drop block at goal position
    Make sure the gripper is above the block before picking it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above block, the robot should put gripper above block.
    If the gripper isn't on the block, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab block.
    Once the block is in the gripper, we can move it to the goal position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around block and the block is not located at the goal position, the robot should move block to goal position.
    Once the block is at the target location, release it.
    - When the block is located at the goal position, the robot should drop block at goal position.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Move the block to the target location  4. Place the block
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with block, the robot should put gripper above block.
    If the block isn't grabbed by the gripper, grab the block by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with block and the robot's gripper is not around block, the robot should close gripper around block.
    Now that the block is grabbed by the gripper, move the block to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around block, the robot should move block to target location.
    Once the block is above the target location, release the block.
    - When the block is above target location and the robot's gripper is holding block, the robot should place block.

    Steps:  1. Move gripper in front of the block  2. Put gripper under the block  3. Raise gripper to pick up the block  4. Move the block to goal  5. Place the block at the goal location
    The robot needs to first move the gripper in front of the block to set it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the block, the robot should move gripper in front of block.
    Once the gripper is in front of the block, drop the gripper beneath it to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not under the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper under the block.
    Now that the gripper is beneath the block, we can lift up the gripper to pick up the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is under the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around block.
    We've picked up the block, so move it back to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should move block to goal.
    We're at the goal, so place the block down.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot is near the goal, the robot should place block at goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Drop gripper around block  3. Close gripper around block  4. Move block to goal  5. Release gripper  
    First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place gripper above block.
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around block.
    If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around block.
    We closed the gripper, and the block is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the block to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place block at goal.
    Once the block is at the goal location, release the gripper to free the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should release gripper.
