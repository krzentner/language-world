Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Sorry, it looks like there's a duplicate function here - this is the same as the one above!
Sorry, it seems like there's a duplicate function name. Did you mean to define a different action for the robot to perform?
Oops, it seems like we already have a function for closing the drawer. Maybe you meant to create a different function? Let me know if I can help!
# Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle
    # 2. Push the drawer closed
    # If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the drawer handle")
    # If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can
    # push the drawer closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the drawer handle")
I noticed that there are two function definitions with the same name "drawer_close". Please rename one of them to avoid confusion.
