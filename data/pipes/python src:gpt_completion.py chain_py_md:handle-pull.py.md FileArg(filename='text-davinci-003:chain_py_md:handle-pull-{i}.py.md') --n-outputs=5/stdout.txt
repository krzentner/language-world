Steps:
1. Put gripper above handle
2. Drop gripper around handle
3. Pull up the handle

# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Pull up the handle
    # We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, because
    # of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab
    # the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull the handle up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")


The code that follows should read as such:

```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle 
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Pull the handle up
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Next, put the gripper around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, pull the handle up.
    if check("robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


The program should be:
```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Pull up the handle
    # First, put the gripper almost above the handle, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # If the gripper is near the handle and open, maybe we can pull it up by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle")
    # We closed the gripper, and the handle is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to pull the handle up.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


The code should be:
```
# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Drop the gripper around the handle
    #  3. Pull the handle up
    # First, move the gripper vertically above the handle so that it's possible to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around handle")
    # As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the handle, pull it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper behind the handle
2. Drop gripper around handle
3. Pull the handle up

# handle-pull: pull up the handle
# def handle_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper behind the handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Pull the handle up
    # First, put the gripper behind the handle, so that the gripper can get a
    # good grip on the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper behind handle")
    # As long as the gripper is behind the handle, grab the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind the handle and the gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # If the gripper is already around the handle and closed, pull the handle up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
