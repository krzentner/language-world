    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near handle
    #  2. Pull up handle
    # To start, just move the gripper near the handle.
    # We don't need to be precise with the direction, since we'll be pulling
    # up the handle.

    # If the handle is forward of the gripper, we can just pull it up.

        robot.pull("handle up")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle
    #  2. Grab the handle with the gripper
    #  3. Pull up on the handle
    # First, if the handle isn't left of the gripper, put the gripper around the
    # handle.
    if check("the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):

    # around the handle, pull up on the handle.
    if check("the handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("up on the handle")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Grab handle
    #  3. Pull up handle 
    # We need to first put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it,
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab
    # the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull up the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper right of the handle
    #  2. Start pulling up on the handle
    #  3. Pull harder to open the handle
    # To start, put the robot's gripper to the right of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.grab("handle from the side")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the handle, we can start pulling on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
        robot.pull("up on the handle")
    # As we're pulling harder on the handle, the handle will open more and more.
    # So keep pulling until it's open.
    if check("the handle is still not open"):
        robot.pull("harder to open the handle")

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around the handle
    #  3. Pull the handle up
    # To pull the handle up, we need to grab it in the right spot.
    # Put the gripper above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Now the gripper is around the handle and can pull it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
