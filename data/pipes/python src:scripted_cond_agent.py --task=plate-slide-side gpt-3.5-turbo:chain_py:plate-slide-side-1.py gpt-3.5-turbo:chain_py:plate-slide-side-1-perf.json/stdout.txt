# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Move the gripper to the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.

    # If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the plate.
    # Because the plate is a flat object, we need to check if the gripper is
    # around it and not just above it.
    if check("plate is not left of the gripper and the plate is not grasped by the gripper"):

    # slide it sideways.
