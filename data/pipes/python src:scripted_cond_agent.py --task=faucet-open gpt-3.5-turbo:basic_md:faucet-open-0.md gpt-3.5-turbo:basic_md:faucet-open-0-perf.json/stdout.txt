To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper to the right of the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the faucet handle is turned off, the robot should grip the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle left to open the faucet. 
- The robot should stop turning the handle left once the desired water flow is achieved.
