# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Position the stick near the thermos
    # 2. Use the stick to slide the thermos to the target location
    # First, position the stick roughly near the thermos. We cannot bump the thermos while positioning the stick, so we need to be careful here.
