Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Here's the code for the `drawer_open` task:

```
# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
# def drawer_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above drawer handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
    #  3. Pull open the drawer
    # We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it,
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to
    # grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the drawer handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer
    # open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle and the drawer is not open"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the drawer handle")
``` 

Hope that helps!

Here's the code to perform the `drawer-open` task:

```
# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above drawer handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
    #  3. Pull open the drawer
    # We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it,
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to
    # grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer
    # open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the drawer handle")
        robot.move_gripper("near the top of the drawer", close_gripper=True)
```

This code first checks that the gripper is above the drawer handle, then moves it around the handle and checks it is around it. Finally, it completes the task by moving the gripper horizontally to the end of the drawer and then pulling it open.
