    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the plate  2. Move the gripper back and sideways to push the plate  3. Push the plate as it moves back
    First, put the gripper to the side of the plate.
    - When the gripper is not at the side of the plate, the robot should move gripper to side of plate.
    Once the gripper is to the side of the plate, we should move the gripper back and sideways to push the plate.
    - When the gripper is side aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not behind plate, the robot should push plate back sideways.
    Once the robot is pushing the plate, continue pushing it until it is back in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind plate and the plate is not in target location, the robot should push plate back until in target location.
