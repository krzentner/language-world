    #  1. Put gripper near the faucet handle
    #  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper
    #  3. Turn the handle left to open the faucet
    #  4. Turn the handle harder if the faucet isn't open yet
    # Move the robot's gripper close to the faucet handle from the side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle"):

    # Now that the handle is grabbed, turning the robot's gripper left should
    # open the faucet.

    # If the handle didn't turn enough to open the faucet, turn it harder until
    # it does.
