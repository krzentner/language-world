To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Approach the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Drive towards the hoop  4. Raise the gripper to lift the ball  5. Align the ball with the hoop  6. Release the ball into the hoop
First, approach the ball and grab it with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the robot has the ball, it should drive towards the hoop.
- When the robot is not aligned with the hoop, move the robot until it's close to the hoop
Once the robot is close to the hoop, it should raise the gripper to lift the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop
The robot should then align the ball with the hoop before releasing it.
- When the ball is not aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the ball is aligned with the hoop
Finally, the robot should release the ball into the hoop by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is closed and the ball is aligned with the hoop, open the robot's gripper to release the ball into the hoop.
To put the ball into the hoop, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the hoop  4. Release the ball
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the gripper is not around the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    - When the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop
    Once the gripper is above the hoop, release the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is closed, release the ball by opening the gripper.
To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the ball  2. Open the gripper and lower it around the ball  3. Close the gripper around the ball  4. Reach towards the hoop  5. Lift the ball while guiding it towards the hoop  6. Release the ball once it's above the hoop
First, put the gripper above the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the basketball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the basketball
If the gripper is above the basketball but isn't around it, open the gripper and lower it around the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the basketball and the robot's gripper is not around the basketball, open the gripper and lower it around the basketball
Once the gripper is closed around the basketball, reach towards the hoop.
   - Move the robot's gripper towards the hoop
To guide the ball towards the hoop while lifting it, keep moving the gripper towards the hoop while lifting the ball.
   - Move the robot's gripper towards the hoop while gradually lifting the ball
Once the ball is above the hoop, release the gripper to drop the ball into the hoop.
   - When the basketball is above the hoop, release the gripper to drop the basketball into the hoop.
The task `basketball` requires the robot to pick up the ball, move it to a position above the hoop, and drop it so that it goes through the hoop. To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball  3. Close gripper around the ball  4. Move ball above the hoop  5. Open gripper to drop the ball into the hoop

First, move the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
Next, drop the gripper around the ball and close it to grab the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
Move the ball to a position above the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball and the ball is not above the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the ball is above the hoop
Open the gripper to drop the ball into the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball and the ball is above the hoop, open the gripper to drop the ball into the hoop.

    Next, move the gripper to above the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop
    Finally, drop the ball into the hoop by opening the gripper while the gripper is above the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is open
