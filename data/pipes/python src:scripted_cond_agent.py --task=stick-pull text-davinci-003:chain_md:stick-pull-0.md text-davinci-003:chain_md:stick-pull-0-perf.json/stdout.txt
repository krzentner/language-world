    Steps:  1. Put gripper on stick handle  2. Grip stick handle firmly  3. Push the stick towards the thermos  4. When stick is close, pull the thermos to desired location
    First, put the gripper below the stick handle. To be able to pull the thermos, this stick handle must be securely in the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below stick handle, the robot should put gripper below stick handle.
    If the stick handle is below the robot's gripper, grip the stick handle tightly with the gripper before pushing it.
    - When the stick handle is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not gripping the stick handle, the robot should grip stick handle.
    If the gripper is gripping the stick handle and the stick is near the thermos, we can start to pull the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is gripping stick handle and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should pull the thermos to desired location.
