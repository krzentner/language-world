To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should move gripper above dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above dial, the robot should grab dial firmly.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the dial firmly, the robot should turn the dial to the desired position or direction.
    - When the dial has been turned to the desired position or direction, the robot should release the dial.
