The code should check if the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and put the gripper above the stick.
Then, it should check if the robot's gripper is not near the stick and grab the stick.
Next, it should check if the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos and line the stick up with the thermos.
Finally, it should check if the stick is near the thermos and pull the thermos to the goal location.

```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos"):
        robot.align("stick with thermos")
    if check("the stick is near the thermos"):
        robot.pull("thermos to goal")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.grab("the stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is not horizontally aligned with thermos top"):
        robot.align("the stick with the thermos")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is horizontally aligned with the thermos top"):
        robot.pull("the thermos to the target location")


if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
    robot.place("gripper above stick")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not near stick"):
    robot.grab("stick")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the thermometer is below the stick"):
    robot.pull("stick to the goal")


Answer:

```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the stick"):
        robot.reach("to stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not grabbing the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the thermos is not in front of the robot's gripper and the thermos is not right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.place("stick ahead of thermos")
    if check("the thermos is right of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("stick to the left")
    if check("the thermos is left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("stick to the right")
    if check("the thermos is in front of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.push("stick forward and thermos to goal")
```


Solution:
```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near stick and the robot's gripper is not above stick"):
        robot.put("gripper near stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near thermos and the thermos is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("stick under thermos")
    if check("the stick is under the thermos"):
        robot.pull("thermos to goal")
```
