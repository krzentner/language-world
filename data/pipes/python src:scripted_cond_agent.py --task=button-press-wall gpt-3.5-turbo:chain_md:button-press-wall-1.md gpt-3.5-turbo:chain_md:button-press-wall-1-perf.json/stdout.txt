To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button and above the wall  2. Line up the gripper with the button  3. Push the button from the front
    First, put the gripper in front of the button and above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the button and above the wall, the robot should move gripper in front of button and above the wall.
    Line up the gripper with the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with button, the robot should align gripper with button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push the button from the front. 
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button, the robot should push button from the front.
