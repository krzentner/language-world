Here's the code for the `push_wall` function:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the wall")
    if check("the puck has hit the wall and the robot's gripper is above the puck"):
        robot.lift("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not between the wall and the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move("the gripper to the other side of the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```

This code makes sure that the gripper is in the correct position before attempting to move the puck. It then slides the puck to the wall, lifts the gripper, moves the gripper to the other side of the wall, and then slides the puck to the goal.
