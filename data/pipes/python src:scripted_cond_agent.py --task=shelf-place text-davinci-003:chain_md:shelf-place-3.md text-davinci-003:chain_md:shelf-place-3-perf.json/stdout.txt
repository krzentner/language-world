    Steps:  1. Move gripper in front of the block  2. Put gripper under the block  3. Raise gripper to pick up the block  4. Move the block to goal  5. Place the block at the goal location
    The robot needs to first move the gripper in front of the block to set it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the block, the robot should move gripper in front of block.
    Once the gripper is in front of the block, drop the gripper beneath it to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not under the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper under the block.
    Now that the gripper is beneath the block, we can lift up the gripper to pick up the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is under the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around block.
    We've picked up the block, so move it back to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should move block to goal.
    We're at the goal, so place the block down.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot is near the goal, the robot should place block at goal.
