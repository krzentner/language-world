To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the cube, the robot should lower the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the cube.
- When the robot holds the cube, the robot should move towards the target location.
- When the robot is near the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and release the cube at the target location.
