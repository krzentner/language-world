    Steps: 1. Put gripper around the mug  2. Close the gripper around the mug  3. Pull the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug, the robot should place the gripper around mug.
    If the gripper isn't near the mug, move it to the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the mug, the robot should move gripper to mug.
    If the gripper is near the mug, try to close the gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug.
    Now that the gripper is closed around the mug, pull it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug, the robot should pull the mug to the target location.
