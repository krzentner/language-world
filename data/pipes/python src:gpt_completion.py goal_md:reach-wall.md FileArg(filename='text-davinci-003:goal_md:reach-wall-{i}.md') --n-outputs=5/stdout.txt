Steps:  1. Reach to the wall with the gripper  2. Line up the gripper with the target location  3. Move the gripper around the wall  4. Reach to the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall
- When the robot's gripper is near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the target location
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not around the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wall
- When the robot's gripper is around the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location


Steps:  1. Reach towards the beginning of the wall  2. Push to move the robot's gripper over the wall  3. Reach to the target location
    The robot can reach over the wall, so it should start by reaching towards the beginning of the wall. 
- When the robot's gripper is not near the beginning of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the beginning of the wall
Once the gripper is near the beginning of the wall, it should push over the wall towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the beginning of the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall and the robot's gripper is near the target

    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the wall  2. Reach to target location
    First, move the robot's gripper so that it is on the wall and not in the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the wall and the wall is above the reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the wall
    Now that the gripper is on the wall, reach to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

    Steps:  1. Get the robot's gripper on one side of the wall  2. Move the robot's gripper around the wall  3. Reach to the target location
    First, get the robot's gripper on one side of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the wall
    When the robot's gripper is left of the wall, move the gripper around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the wall and the wall is not between the robot's gripper and the target location, move the robot's gripper until the wall is halfway between the robot's gripper and the target location
    Now that the wall is in between the gripper and the target location, make sure the gripper is still lined up before we move in.
    - When the wall is between the robot's gripper and the target location and the robot's gripper is not lined up with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the wall and the robot's gripper is lined up with the target location
    Now the robot's gripper should reach the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is lined up with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location


Steps:  1. Put gripper above wall  2. Move gripper to left of wall  3. Reach above wall to the target location
First, put the gripper above the wall so that it lines up with the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall 
If the gripper isn't to the left of the wall, move to the left of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not to the left of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the left of the wall
Now that the gripper is above and to the left of the wall, reach above the wall to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above wall and to the left of wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
