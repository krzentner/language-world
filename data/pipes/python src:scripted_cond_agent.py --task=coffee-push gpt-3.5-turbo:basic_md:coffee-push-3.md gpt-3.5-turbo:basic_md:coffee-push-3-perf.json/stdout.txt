To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug and the mug is not near the target location, the robot should lift the mug and move it towards the target location.
- When the mug is near the target location, the robot should place the mug at the target location by opening the gripper.
