    Steps:  1. Put the wrench in front of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the wrench  3. Move the wrench and peg together to form the desired assembly
    First, put the wrench in front of the peg.
    - When the wrench is not in front of the peg, the robot should put wrench in front of peg.
    Once the wrench is lined up in front of the peg, try to grab the peg with the wrench.
    - When the peg is not in the wrench and the wrench is in front of the peg, the robot should grab peg.
    Lastly, once the peg is in the wrench, form the desired assembly by moving the wrench and peg together.
    - When the peg is in the wrench, the robot should move wrench and peg together to form the desired assembly.
