# peg-unplug-side: pull the peg out from the side

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Pull the peg out sideways from the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.

        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined
    # up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.align("peg to hole")
    # Once the peg is properly aligned, we can pull it out from the hole by
    # moving the gripper sideways.
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.pull("peg out sideways from the hole")
