    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the edge of the plate
    #  2. Push against the edge of the plate to slide it
    #  3. Push the plate harder to slide it faster
    # First, move the gripper near the edge of the plate.
    # Since the plate is larger than the gripper, check if the gripper is near
    # the plate instead of around it.
    if check("the gripper is not near the plate"):

    # the plate away from the gripper.
