    If the gripper is not around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the box lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box
