    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle
    #  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper
    #  3. Turn the faucet handle left
    # First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle"):

    # If the faucet handle is left of the gripper, go back to putting the
    # gripper above the faucet handle.
    # Because the faucet handle is a circular object, check if the gripper is
    # lined up with it from the front instead of around it.

    # handle is not turned, turn it left.
