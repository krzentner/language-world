    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line up the plate with the target location  4. Slide the plate into its target location
    First, put the gripper left of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not around the plate, put it around the plate by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the plate is lined up with the target location, slide it into the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is lined up with its target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Move the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    When the gripper is above the plate, move the plate sideways until it is in the desired location.
    - When the plate is directly above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate 
    Now that the plate is in the desired position, the robot can move left to move the plate sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Put gripper against the plate  3. Push the plate sideways
    Put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the gripper is above the plate, the robot needs to push the plate to move it. We need to put the gripper up against the plate to do that. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not against the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is against the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is against the plate, slide it sideways until it's in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is against the plate and the plate is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location


Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Align the plate with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not roughly vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the robot's gripper isn't above the plate, check if the gripper is forward aligned with the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Once the plate is lined up with the target location, slide the plate into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper horizontally forward of the plate  2. Grasp the plate with the gripper  3. Move the plate to the target location
    To accurately move the plate, we should start by putting the gripper ahead of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the plate, we can grasp it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    Now that the robot has grasped the plate, it can be moved to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
