The steps for the program should be:

1. Put gripper above the dial
2. Drop gripper around the dial
3. Turn the dial clockwise

# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial clockwise
    # First, put the gripper above the dial, so that we make sure to grab it
    # correctly.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the dial")
    # If the gripper is lined up roughly, make sure to move the gripper around
    # the dial to trap it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the dial, we should be able to turn it clockwise
    # by moving the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the dial")


Then, add the following code to perform the task:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper around the knob of the dial
    #  2. Turn the knob
    # We need to put the gripper around the knob of the dial before we can turn
    # it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the knob of the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the knob of the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up with the knob, we can just turn the knob.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the knob of the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("to the right")
```


```

    #  3. Turn the dial with the robot's gripper
    # Put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the dial")

    # Once the gripper is aligned with the dial, close the gripper while gently
    # applying pressure to begin turning the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not closed"):

    # motion to turn the dial depending on the desired direction.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("left/right of the dial")
```
