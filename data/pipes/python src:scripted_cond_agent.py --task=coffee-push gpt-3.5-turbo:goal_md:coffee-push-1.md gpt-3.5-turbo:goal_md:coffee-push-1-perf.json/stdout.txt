To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the mug handle 
           2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper 
           3. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the mug handle, we can hold the mug and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Make sure that the mug is stable and can't spill as the robot moves it to the target location. Once it's in position, release the gripper to set the mug down.
