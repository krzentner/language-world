To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably for the task `coffee-push`, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should move the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should lift the mug and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should release the mug at the target location.
