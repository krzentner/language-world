    Steps:  1. Put robot's gripper above the box lid  2. Reach the box lid with the gripper  3. Close gripper around the box lid 4. Lift the box lid 5. Place the box lid onto the box
    First, move the gripper above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    If the gripper isn't near the box lid, reach out and grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we have the box lid trapped within the gripper, lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the box lid is no longer in contact with the box
    Finally, move the gripper to the target location and carefully place the box lid. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
