    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push handle downwards 
    First, put the gripper roughly above handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, the robot should place gripper above handle.
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around handle.
    We closed the gripper, and the handle is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to push the handle downwards. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push handle downwards.
