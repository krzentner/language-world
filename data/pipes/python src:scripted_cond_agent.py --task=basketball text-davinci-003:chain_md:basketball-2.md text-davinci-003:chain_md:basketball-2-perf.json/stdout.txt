    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the basketball  2. Position the basketball under the hoop  3. Lift the basketball up and release over the hoop  4. Drop the basketball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper around the basketball to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around basketball, the robot should move gripper around basketball.
    Once the gripper is around the basketball, slowly position it under the hoop, using the gripper as a stabilizer.
    - When the basketball is not under the hoop and the robot's gripper is not in the center of the basketball, the robot should position basketball under the hoop.
    Then, lift the basketball up and release it over the hoop.
    - When the basketball is under the hoop and the robot's gripper is in the center of the basketball, the robot should lift the basketball up and release it over the hoop.
    Finally, drop the basketball into the hoop.
    - When the basketball is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is in the center of the basketball, the robot should drop the basketball into the hoop.
