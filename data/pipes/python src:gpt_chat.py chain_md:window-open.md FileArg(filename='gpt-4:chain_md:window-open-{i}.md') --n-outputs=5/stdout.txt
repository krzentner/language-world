The robot should perform the following steps to slide the window open to the left reliably:

1. Check if the robot's gripper is vertically lined up with the window handle.
   - If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, move gripper to the right of the window handle.

2. Once the gripper is lined up with the window handle, start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
   - If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, slide the window open by moving the gripper to the left.

3. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder to open the window fully.
   - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push the window left harder.

2. If the gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide the window to the left.
3. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder. The robot should continue pushing the window harder until it is fully open.
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the window open to the left reliably:

1. Put gripper right of the window handle
2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window
3. Push the window open harder 

If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, the gripper should be moved near the window handle to start pushing. If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, it can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, it should push harder.
