Solution: 

# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the door handle
    #  2. Put gripper around door handle
    #  3. Push the door closed
    # First, move the gripper near the door handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.move("gripper near door handle")
    # Now we can grab the door handle with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("door handle")
    # Now that we have the door handle, we can push the door closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door handle"):
        robot.push("door closed")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above door handle
  2. Drop gripper around door handle
  3. Push door closed

If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle, move the gripper above it.

if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle"):
    robot.put("gripper above door handle")

If the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move it around the handle so it will close it.

if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle"):
    robot.drop("gripper around door handle")

Once the gripper is around the door handle, push the door closed.

if check("the robot's gripper is around door handle"):
    robot.push("door closed")


The Steps to complete this task are:
1. Put gripper near door handle
2. Push the door closed

Step 1: Put gripper near door handle
```
    # If the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door
    # handle. We don't need to be sure it's perfectly lined up in order to 
    # close the door, so we can just get it near the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.grab("door handle")
```

Step 2: Push the door closed
```
    # Once the gripper is near the door handle, start pushing against it to 
    # close the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door handle"):
        robot.push("door closed")
```

All the code together should look like this:
```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # If the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door
    # handle. We don't need to be sure it's perfectly lined up in order to 
    # close the door, so we can just get it near the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.grab("door handle")
    # Once the gripper is near the door handle, start pushing against it to 
    # close the door.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door handle"):
        robot.push("door closed")
```


Here's the code for the door-close task:

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above door handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around door handle
    #  3. Push the door closed
    # Put the gripper roughly above the door handle before we can grab it, 
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the door handle, we should be able to 
    # grab the door handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the door handle, we just need to push the door
    # closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around door handle"):
        robot.push("door closed")
```


The program should be written as follows: 

```
# door-close: push the door closed to the target location
# def door_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle
    #  2. Push the door closed
    # If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door
    # handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.grab("door handle")
    # If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can
    # push the door closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with door handle"):
        robot.push("door closed")
```
