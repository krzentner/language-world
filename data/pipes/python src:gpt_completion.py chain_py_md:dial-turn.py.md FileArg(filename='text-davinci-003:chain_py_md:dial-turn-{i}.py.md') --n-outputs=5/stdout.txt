Then add the steps code:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above dial
    #  2. Grab dial with gripper
    #  3. Turn dial
    # First, put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    # If the dial isn't below the gripper, grab it by moving the gripper down
    # around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around dial")
    # Once the gripper is around the dial, we can just start turning it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around dial"):
        robot.turn("dial")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the dial
2. Drop gripper around the dial
3. Turn the dial to the correct position

# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial to the correct position
    # If the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
        robot.put("gripper above dial")
    # Once the gripper is near the dial, drop down around it to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around dial")
    # Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial in the correct direction.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
        robot.turn("dial to correct position")


The goal of this task is to turn the dial in a clockwise direction. 

Steps:

1. Put gripper above the dial 
2. Drop the gripper around the dial
3. Turn the dial clockwise

First, put the gripper above the dial, so that we don't bump it when trying to grab it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
    robot.put("gripper above dial")
```

Once the gripper is lined up above the dial, we should be able to grab the dial by moving the gripper down around it. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial"):
    robot.drop("gripper around dial")
```

Once the gripper is around the dial, we can just turn the dial clockwise. 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around dial"):
    robot.rotate("clockwise")
```

    #  4. Rotate the dial with the gripper
    # We need to put the gripper roughly above the dial before we can grab it, 
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not roughly above dial"):
