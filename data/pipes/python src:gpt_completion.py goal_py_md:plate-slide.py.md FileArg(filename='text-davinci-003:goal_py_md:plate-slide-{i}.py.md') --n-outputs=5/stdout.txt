    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the plate isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the plate and close it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")


Assuming that the robot's gripper is open and the plate is currently in front of the gripper, the program should look something like this:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper with the plate 
    #  2. Push the plate horizontally to the target location
    # First, line up the gripper with the plate so that it is almost vertically 
    # aligned with the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper has a grip on the plate, we can slide it towards the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the target location")
```


Steps:
 1. Put the gripper above the plate
 2. Slide the plate to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the gripper above the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
```

If the gripper is above the plate, close the gripper to get a better grip on the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate", close_gripper=True)
```

Finally, if the plate has been gripped, move the plate to the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Drop gripper around the plate
3. Slide the plate towards the target location

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Drop gripper around the plate
    #  3. Slide the plate towards the target location
    # Put the gripper roughly above the plate, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the plate")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the plate, we should be able to slide
    # it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


Then, add the code

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Grip the plate
    #  3. Slide the plate to the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the plate and open, close the gripper to trap the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```
