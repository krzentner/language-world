    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of the plate  2.Get shaped fingers or suction cup onto the plate  3. Slide the plate towards the target location
    To get the gripper onto the plate, put the gripper onto the edge of the plate so that the gripper has a hold of the plate.
    -When the robot's gripper is not on top of plate and the plate is away from the target location, the robot should put gripper on top of plate.
    If the gripper is on the plate and it's still far from target location, use shaped fingers or suction cup to get grip on the plate.
    -When the robot's gripper is on top of plate and the plate is not gripped, the robot should get shaped fingers or suction cup onto plate. 
    Once the plate is being gripped, slide the plate back towards the target location.
    -When the robot's gripper is on top of plate and the plate is gripped, the robot should slide plate towards target location.
