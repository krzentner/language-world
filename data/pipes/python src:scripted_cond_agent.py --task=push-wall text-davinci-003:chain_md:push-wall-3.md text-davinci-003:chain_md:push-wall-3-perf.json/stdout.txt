    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Move the gripper left until it is against the wall  3. Push the puck towards the goal
    We want to push the puck to the target location, but there's a wall in the way, so the first step is to move the gripper to the side and make sure it is against the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not against wall and the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should move the gripper to the left and against the wall.
    When the gripper is against the wall and in the same position as the puck, the wall should also prevent the puck from moving away; at this point, we can push the puck to the goal. 
    - When the robot's gripper is against the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should push the puck towards goal.
