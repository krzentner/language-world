Sure, here's the completed code for the `pick-place-wall` task:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open and there is a short wall in the way"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of the wall")
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open and there is no wall in the way"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")
```

This code first checks if the gripper is already above the puck. If not, the robot moves the gripper to be above the puck. Then, it checks if there is a wall in the gripper's way. If there is, the robot moves the gripper to the side of the wall before dropping it around the puck. If there is no wall in the way, the robot can immediately drop the gripper around the puck. Finally, the robot closes the gripper, moves it to the target location, and opens it again to place the puck at the goal.
