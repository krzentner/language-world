To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should turn dial to the required position to unlock the door. The exact steps to turn the dial will depend on the design of the dial and the door.
