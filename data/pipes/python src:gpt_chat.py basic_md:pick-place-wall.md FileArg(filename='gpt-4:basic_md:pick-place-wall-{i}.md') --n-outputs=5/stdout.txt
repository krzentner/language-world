To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and there is a wall in between, the robot should move gripper to the side of target location while keeping the puck in hand.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location without any obstructions, the robot should move gripper over target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above target location, the robot should lower the puck to the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck vertically.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should lower the gripper down to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the puck and open gripper.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- With the puck in its gripper, the robot should move its gripper above the wall.
- Once the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should move its gripper over to the target location while keeping the puck in its gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location while taking care not to let the gripper hit the wall.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the puck is in the gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is beside the wall, the robot should lift the gripper and move it above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall and the goal location is visible, the robot should move the gripper towards the goal location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should drop gripper around puck, taking into consideration the presence of the short wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck, again taking into consideration the presence of the short wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck while moving the gripper upward and also moving it away from the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the gripper with the puck while also moving it to the side to avoid colliding with the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is over the target location and above the wall, the robot should release the puck by opening its gripper.
