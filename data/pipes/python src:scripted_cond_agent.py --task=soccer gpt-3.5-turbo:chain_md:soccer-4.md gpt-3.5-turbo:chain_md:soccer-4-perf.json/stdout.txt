To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper  3. Push the ball towards the target location
First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
If the soccer ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should grab the soccer ball with the gripper.
- When the soccer ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should grab soccer ball with the gripper.
Once the soccer ball is grabbed, move the gripper to push the ball towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball, the robot should push the ball towards the target location.
