    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Line up the handle  3. Push down on the handle
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can line it up, since we're pushing it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, line up the handle so that it's positioned correctly.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    If the handle is aligned with the gripper on the side, push down on the handle to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle


Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the handle  2. Align the gripper with the handle  3. Push the handle down
- When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
- When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not horizontally or vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the handle
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle and then push the handle down with the robot's gripper.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle, aligning it as if it were viewed from the side  2. Move the gripper up and down, pushing down the handle  3. Push harder to press the handle down
    If the robot's gripper is not on the side of the handle, move the gripper before adjusting the direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is not to the side of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the side of the handle
    If the robot's gripper is to the side of the handle, we can push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the side of the handle, move the robot's gripper up and down until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle
    If the handle isn't pressed all the way down, press harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is pressing the handle, move the robot's gripper in the down direction until the handle is totally pressed down

    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of handle  2. Push down on handle 
    First, we need to line the gripper up to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the handle  2. Push down on the handle from the side  3. Move the handle down to its locked position
    If the handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper until it is near the handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is near the handle, start pushing on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    If the handle is aligned with the gripper, and the gripper is moving to push the handle, slowly move the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is pushing down on the handle
