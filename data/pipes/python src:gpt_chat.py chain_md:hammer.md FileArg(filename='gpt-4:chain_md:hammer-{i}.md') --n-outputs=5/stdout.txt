To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Place the hammer above the nail  2. Grasp the handle of the hammer  3. Lift the hammer  4. Move the hammer above the nail  5. Swing the hammer down to hit the nail  6. Repeat steps 4-5 until nail is completely driven in
    First, put the hammer above the nail so that it's ready to swing down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.
    Once the hammer is above the nail, grasp the handle of the hammer with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail and not grasping the handle, the robot should grasp the handle of the hammer.
    Lift the hammer so that it has room to swing down and hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is grasping the handle of the hammer and not lifted, the robot should lift the hammer.
    Move the hammer above the nail, making sure it's lined up with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper has lifted the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, the robot should move the hammer above the nail and align it.
    Swing the hammer down to hit the nail. Repeat steps 4-5 until the nail is completely driven in.
    - When the hammer has hit the nail but the nail is not completely driven in, the robot should repeat steps 4-5 until the nail is completely driven in.
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Pick up the hammer by the handle  2. Position the hammer above the nail  3. Swing the hammer down towards the nail  4. Repeat until the nail is fully driven in
First, the robot needs to pick up the hammer by the handle, which may involve lining up the gripper with the handle and closing it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is above the handle, the robot should drop gripper around hammer handle.
    Once the robot is holding the hammer, position it above the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should position the hammer above the nail.
The robot should then swing the hammer down towards the nail.
    - When the hammer is not swinging towards nail, the robot should swing the hammer towards the nail.
Finally, repeat the process of swinging the hammer down towards the nail until the nail is fully driven in.
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
Steps: 1. Put the hammer above the nail  2. Move the hammer down to the nail  3. Swing the hammer to hit the nail
First, put the hammer above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.
Next, move the hammer down towards the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is above the nail, the robot should move the hammer down to the nail.
Finally, swing the hammer to hit the nail.
- When the hammer is above the nail and has been moved down to the nail, the robot should swing the hammer to hit the nail.
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Hold the hammer above the nail  2. Move the hammer down to hit the nail

First, the robot should hold the hammer roughly above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.

Once the hammer is roughly above the nail, the robot should move the hammer down to hit the nail with the correct amount of force.
- When the robot's gripper is above the nail, the robot should hit the nail with the hammer.

It's important for the robot to be precise with its movements so that it hits the nail accurately and with the right amount of force.
The task `hammer` requires the robot to hit the nail with the hammer. To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Hold the hammer near the top of the handle  2. Line up the hammer with the nail  3. Swing the hammer down onto the nail
    First, hold the hammer near the top of the handle as it gives better control.
    - When the robot's gripper is not holding the hammer or is holding the hammer incorrectly, the robot should pick up the hammer correctly.
    Next, line up the hammer with the nail head.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the head of the nail or it is not above the nail, the robot should place hammer above the nail head.
    Finally, swing the hammer down onto the head of the nail with enough force to drive it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the head of the nail and the hammer is over the nail, the robot should swing the hammer down onto the nail with the desired force.
