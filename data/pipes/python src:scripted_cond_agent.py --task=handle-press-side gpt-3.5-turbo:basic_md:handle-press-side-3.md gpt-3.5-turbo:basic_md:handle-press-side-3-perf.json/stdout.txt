To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle, the robot should push sideways on the handle to push it down.
