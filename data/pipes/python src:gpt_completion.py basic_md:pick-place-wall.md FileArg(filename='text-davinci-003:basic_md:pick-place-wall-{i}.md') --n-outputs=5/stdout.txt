    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall is in the way, the robot should move its gripper to the side of the puck in order to be able to reach the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the wall is still in the way, the robot should reach around the wall and place its gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the wall is still in the way, the robot should close its gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck, the robot should move to the target location and place the puck there.

    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should navigate around the wall to the target location and then place the puck on the wall.


The robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should move gripper above puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should move gripper near puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
   - When the gripper is closed around the puck and the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should navigate around the wall to the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should place puck at goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is not {above/at an angle} to the puck and the short wall, the robot should move gripper {above/at an angle} to the puck and the short wall
    - When the robot's gripper is {above/at an angle} to the puck and the short wall and the robot's gripper is not near the puck and wall, the robot should lower gripper to the puck such that the wall is between the puck and the robot's gripper
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and wall and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck, the robot should drop gripper around puck so it can catch short wall for stability.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal, while holding onto the wall.
