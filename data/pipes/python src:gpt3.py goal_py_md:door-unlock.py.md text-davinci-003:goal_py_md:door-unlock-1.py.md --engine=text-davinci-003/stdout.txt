    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial to unlock the door
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the dial, so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):

        robot.move_gripper("near the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the dial, we can turn it.
