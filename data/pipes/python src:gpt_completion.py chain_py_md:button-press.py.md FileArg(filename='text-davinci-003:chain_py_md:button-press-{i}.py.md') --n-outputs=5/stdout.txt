Steps:
1. Align the gripper as viewed from in front
2. Push the button from the front

    # First, put the gripper in front of the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper in front of button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button"):
        robot.push("on button")


Steps:
1. Put the gripper in front of the button 
2. Nudge the button 
3. Push down on the button 

```
# button-press: push the button from the front
# def button_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of button
    #  2. Nudge the button 
    #  3. Push down on the button 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper in front of button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button"):
        robot.nudge("button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is still horizontally aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


# button-press: push the button from the front
# def button_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the robot's gripper to the button
    #  2. Push down on the button
    # First, the robot's gripper should be moved to the button. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.move("gripper to button")
    # Once the gripper is near the button, push down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")


Then, add the following code to the program:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Align the gripper with the button from the front
    #  2. Push down on the button
    # To start, line the robot's gripper up with the button from the front.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button"):
        robot.align("gripper with the button")
    # Once the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


The program should be able to perform the following steps:

1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the front
2. Push down on the button

The code should look like this:

```
# button-press: push the button from the front
# def button_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the front
    #  2. Push down on the button
    # We need to line up the gripper from the front.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button"):
        robot.put("gripper towards button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
