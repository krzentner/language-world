if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial"):
    robot.put("gripper above dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.turn("dial to the right to lock")


This code should be written as follows:

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door lock"):
        robot.put("gripper above door lock")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door lock"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise")
    if check("the robot's gripper is movements detect no lock engaged"):
        robot.release("gripper")
```
 

if check("the robot's gripper is not below the lock dial"):
    robot.move("gripper below lock dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the lock dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("gripper around lock dial")
if check("the robot's gripper is below the lock dial and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.turn("clockwise to lock door")


Here's the program:

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door lock dial"):
        robot.reach("to door lock dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door lock dial and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("door lock dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door lock dial and the door lock dial is rotated to the left"):
        robot.turn("door lock dial clockwise")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door lock dial and the door lock dial is rotated to the right"):
        robot.turn("door lock dial counter-clockwise")    
```


Solution:

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the doorknob"):
        robot.put("gripper above the doorknob")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the doorknob"):
        robot.align("gripper horizontally with the doorknob")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the doorknob"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise or counterclockwise to lock or unlock the door")
```
