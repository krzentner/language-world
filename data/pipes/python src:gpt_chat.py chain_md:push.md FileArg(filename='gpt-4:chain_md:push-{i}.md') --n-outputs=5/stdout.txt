To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the puck.
If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move it above the puck.

2. Drop gripper around the puck.
If the gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, drop it around the puck.

3. Push the gripper into the top of the puck.
If the gripper is vertically aligned with the puck but not near it, move it down to the puck.

4. Slide the puck to the goal.
If the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the gripper, slide the puck to the goal.  

5. Close gripper to trap the puck.
If the gripper is close to the puck, close it to trap the puck and ensure we keep control of it.
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the puck to the target location:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Move gripper down to align with puck
4. Push gripper into top of puck
5. If gripper is close to puck, close gripper
6. Slide gripper and puck to the goal
7. Release gripper at target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper above puck and move it down so it's just above the puck.
2. Open the gripper to be able to grab the puck.
3. Move the gripper down to grab the puck.
4. Move the gripper up and align it with the target location.
5. Move the gripper down to put the puck on the target location.
6. Close the gripper to release the puck.
To slide the puck to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. If the gripper is not above the puck, move the gripper above the puck
3. Drop gripper around puck
4. If the gripper is not around the puck, place the gripper around the puck
5. Close gripper around puck
6. If the gripper is not near the puck or not vertically aligned with the puck, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it
7. If the gripper is near the puck, trap the puck by pushing down on it from above and move the gripper to slide the puck
8. If the puck is below the gripper, slide the puck to the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the puck.
2. Drop gripper around the puck.
3. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, align the gripper with the puck.
4. If the gripper is not close to the puck, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
5. If the gripper is not yet grasping the puck, push the gripper into the top of the puck to trap it.
6. Close the gripper to ensure control over the puck.
7. Move the gripper and the puck to the target location.
8. If necessary, release the gripper to release the puck.
