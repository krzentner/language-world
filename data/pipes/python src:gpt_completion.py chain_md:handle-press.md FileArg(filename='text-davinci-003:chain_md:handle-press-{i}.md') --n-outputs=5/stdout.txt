    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push down on handle
    Firstly, the robot should put the gripper in front of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper in front of handle
    If the gripper is near the handle, drop it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is around the handle, we can push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should push down on handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper     3. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, grab it by dropping the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle we can just push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should push handle down.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push handle down
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle, and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should push down handle.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push handle down
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around handle.
    We closed the gripper, and the handle is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to push the handle down. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push handle down.


The robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push down on handle
    First, we need to get the gripper in the right position above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    Now that we have the gripper around the handle, just push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should push down on handle.
