Steps:
  1. Put gripper above lid
  2. Grab lid with gripper
  3. Place lid onto box
  4. Push lid on to box

# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lid
    #  2. Grab lid with gripper
    #  3. Place lid onto box
    #  4. Push lid on to box
    # First, put the gripper above the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above lid")
    # Then, grab the lid with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the lid and the robot's gripper is not around the lid"):
        robot.grab("lid")
    # Place the lid onto the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lid"):
        robot.place("lid on box")
    # Finally, push the lid onto the box to close it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lid"):
        robot.push("lid onto box")


The steps for the `box-close` task are as follows:
  1. Put gripper roughly above the box lid
  2. Grasp the lid with the gripper
  3. With the lid in the gripper, move the robot over the box
  4. Slowly lower the lid onto the box

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly above the box lid
    #  2. Grasp the lid with the gripper
    #  3. With the lid in the gripper, move the robot over the box
    #  4. Slowly lower the lid onto the box
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above box lid")
    # If the gripper is above the box lid, try to grab it. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box lid"):
        robot.grab("box lid")
    # If the box lid is in the gripper, move the robot over the box.
    if check("the box lid is in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move("over the box")
    # With the lid in the gripper, slowly lower the lid onto the box.
    if check("the robot is above the box and the box lid is in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slowly("lower the lid onto the box")
```


Steps: 
1. Put the gripper on top of the lid
2. Open the gripper to grab the lid
3. Lift the lid and bring it towards the box
4. Place the lid on the box

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper on top of the lid
    #  2. Open the gripper to grab the lid
    #  3. Lift the lid and bring it towards the box
    #  4. Place the lid on the box
    # Put the gripper above the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above lid")
    # Once the gripper is above the lid, open it to grab the lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lid"):
        robot.open("gripper grabbed lid")
    # Now that the gripper is closed around the lid, move the lid towards the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the lid"):
        robot.lift("lid towards box")
    # Assuming the gripper moved the lid to the box, now we can just place the lid on the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box and the lid is above the box"):
        robot.place("lid on box")


Then implement the program:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the box lid
    #  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper
    #  3. Put the box lid on the box
    #  4. Close the box lid
    # First, the robot needs to put the gripper above the box lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above box lid")
    # If the box lid is to the left of the gripper, move the gripper to the box
    # lid.
    if check("the box lid is to the left of the gripper and the gripper is not near the box lid"):
        robot.move("gripper to box lid")
    # If the gripper is near the box lid and open, try to grab it by closing the
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    # We closed the gripper, and the box lid is still near the gripper, so we
    # probably grabbed the box lid. Put the box lid on the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on the box")
    # Now that the box lid is on the box, we can try to close the lid by pushing
    # down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.push("down on the box lid")
```


Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the lid
2. Grab the lid with the gripper
3. Place the lid on the box

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the lid
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above lid")
    #  2. Grab the lid with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the lid and the robot's gripper is not around the lid"):
        robot.grab("lid")
    #  3. Place the lid on the box
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lid"):
        robot.place("lid onto box")
```
