Solution:
```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the handle is not to the left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    if check("the handle is to the left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.pull("handle away from wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
        robot.up("gripper up")
```


The code for this specific task should look like this:

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the handle is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    if check("the handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
        robot.pull("up on the handle")
```


Then add the code:
```	
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```


Followed by:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around the handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.pull("upward on handle")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is below the handle"):
    robot.move("gripper to right of handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle"):
    robot.pull("up on handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the handle"):
    robot.pull("up on handle harder")
