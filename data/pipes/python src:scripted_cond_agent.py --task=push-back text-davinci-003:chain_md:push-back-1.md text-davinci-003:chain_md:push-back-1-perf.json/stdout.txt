    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck 2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    We need to put the gripper behind the puck before we can grab it, because the puck is so small.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck, the robot should put gripper behind puck.
    Once the gripper is lined up behind the puck, we should be able to grab the puck by moving the gripper up into it.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck, the robot should push gripper into back of puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck, we can just slide the puck backwards to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should slide puck to goal.
