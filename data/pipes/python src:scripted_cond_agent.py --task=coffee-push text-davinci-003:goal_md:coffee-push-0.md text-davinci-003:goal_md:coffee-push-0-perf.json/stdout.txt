    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Move the mug towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up above the mug, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Now that the robot has the mug, move it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
