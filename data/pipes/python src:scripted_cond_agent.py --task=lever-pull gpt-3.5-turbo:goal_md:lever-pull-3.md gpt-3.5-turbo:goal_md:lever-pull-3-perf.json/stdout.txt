To rotate the lever up, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever handle  2. Pull the gripper up
    First, put the gripper around the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the lever handle, pull it up to rotate the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is open
