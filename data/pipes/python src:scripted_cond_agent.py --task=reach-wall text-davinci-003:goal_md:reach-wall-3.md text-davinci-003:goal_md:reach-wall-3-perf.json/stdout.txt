    Steps:  1. Get the robot's gripper on one side of the wall  2. Move the robot's gripper around the wall  3. Reach to the target location
    First, get the robot's gripper on one side of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the wall
    When the robot's gripper is left of the wall, move the gripper around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the wall and the wall is not between the robot's gripper and the target location, move the robot's gripper until the wall is halfway between the robot's gripper and the target location
    Now that the wall is in between the gripper and the target location, make sure the gripper is still lined up before we move in.
    - When the wall is between the robot's gripper and the target location and the robot's gripper is not lined up with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the wall and the robot's gripper is lined up with the target location
    Now the robot's gripper should reach the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is lined up with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
