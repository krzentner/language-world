Steps:
1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Drop gripper around the peg
3. Pull the wrench off the peg

If the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the gripper to the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
```
    
If the gripper isn't around the peg, drop it around the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
```

If the gripper is around the peg, pull off the wrench by retracting the gripper from the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("upwards away from the peg")
```

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the wrench
    #  2. Trap the wrench by closing the gripper
    #  3. Move the wrench up to release it from the peg
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the wrench, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wrench")
    # If the wrench isn't below the gripper, put it below the gripper by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # If the wrench is below the gripper, move the wrench up to release it from
    # the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("up above the peg")


The robot should be able to perform the following steps to disassemble: 
1. Put the gripper above the wrench. 
2. Drop the gripper around the wrench.
3. Pull the wrench off the peg.

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench
    #  2. Drop gripper around wrench
    #  3. Pull wrench off peg
    # Put the gripper above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # If the wrench isn't around the gripper, move the gripper around the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the wrench")
    # Now that the gripper is around the wrench, pull the wrench off the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the peg")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above wrench
2. Grab wrench with gripper
3. Pull wrench off of the peg

If the robot's gripper is not near the wrench, move it near the wrench.

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off of the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above wrench
    #  2. Grab wrench with gripper
    #  3. Pull wrench off of the peg
    # If the robot's gripper is not near the wrench, move it near the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wrench")
    # Once the gripper is near the wrench, grab the wrench by closing the
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # If the robot has the wrench, pull it off the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the wrench is facing the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("away from the peg")
```


Steps:
  1. Move gripper to above the wrench
  2. Move gripper near the wrench and pinch it with the gripper
  3. Pivot the wrench and pull it off the peg
  
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up with the wrench, pinch the handle of the wrench 
    # with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above thepeg")
    # Once the wrench is firmly in the grip of the robot's gripper, begin to pivot
    # the wrench and pull it off the peg. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the wrench")
