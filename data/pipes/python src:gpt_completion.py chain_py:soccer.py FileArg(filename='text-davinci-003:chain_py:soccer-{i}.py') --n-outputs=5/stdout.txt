    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the soccer ball
    #  2. Push soccer ball towards target
    # If the ball is not near the robot's gripper, move the gripper near the
    # ball.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper in front of soccer ball
    #  2. Push soccer ball to goal
    # If the soccer ball is not within reach of the robot's gripper, move the 
    # gripper in front of the soccer ball.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper just above soccer ball
    #  2. Push soccer ball towards goal
    # First, put the gripper slightly above the soccer ball.
    # We don't want the robot's gripper to bang the soccer ball away, because
    # that would be sloppy.

    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball
    #  2. Push the soccer into the goal
    # The robot needs to place its gripper right over the soccer ball so it can
    # trap it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball"):
