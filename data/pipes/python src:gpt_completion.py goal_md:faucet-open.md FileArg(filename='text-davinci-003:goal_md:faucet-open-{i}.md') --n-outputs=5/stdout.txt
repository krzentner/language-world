Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the faucet handle  2. Grip the handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the handle counter-clockwise  4. Push the handle to the left 

- When the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle 
- When the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed 
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the faucet handle is not counterclockwise, move the robot's gripper until the faucet handle is counterclockwise
- When the faucet is counterclockwise, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pointing left

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around the faucet handle  3. Turn the faucet left
    The robot couldn't turn the faucet without getting a grip on the handle first, so we need it to try to get a grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle
    With the gripper above the handle, we need to try to get a grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the robot has a grip on the handle, it can try turning the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near faucet handle  2. Start turning the faucet handle left  3. Turn the faucet handle harder
    First, move the robot's gripper near the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle
    If the robot's gripper is lined up with the faucet handle from above, start turning the handle left.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle
    If the faucet handle starts to get harder to turn, push harder on the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the handle counter-clockwise
    First, put the gripper above the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the faucet
    If the robot's gripper is above the faucet but not near, move the gripper down until it's near the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is above faucet and the robot's gripper is not near faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet and the robot's gripper is closed 
    Now that the gripper is near the faucet, we can rotate the handle counter-clockwise to turn on the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the handle is turned counter-clockwise

    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the faucet  2. Slowly rotate the faucet handle counterclockwise  3. Increase the pressure and rotate faster
    If the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet and not near it, move the gripper near the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet and not near it, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet
    If the gripper is near the faucet handle, start turning it slowly counterclockwise to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is opened
    If the robot's gripper is close to the faucet handle, then increase the pressure to open the faucet and rotate faster.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is opened
