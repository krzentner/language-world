Steps:
1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Drop gripper around the plate
3. Slide the plate back into the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move it above the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
```

If the robot's gripper is not around the plate, move it around the plate.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the plate", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is around the plate, slide it back into the target location.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```
