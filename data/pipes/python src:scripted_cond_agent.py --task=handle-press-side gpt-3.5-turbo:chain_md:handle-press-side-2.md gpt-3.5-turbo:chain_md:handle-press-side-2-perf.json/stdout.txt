To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Move the gripper down to the side of the handle  3. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is above the handle, move the gripper down to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the side of the handle, the robot should move gripper down to the side of the handle.
    Now that the gripper is on the side of the handle, push down on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is on the side of the handle, the robot should push down on the handle.
