Steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg
2. Drop the gripper around the peg
3. Pull the wrench off the peg

If the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move it to the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
```

If the gripper is above the peg, but not around the peg, drop the gripper around the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg but not around the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the peg", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is around the peg, pull the wrench off the peg.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the wrench")
```
