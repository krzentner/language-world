To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and there is a wall between the robot's gripper and the puck, the robot should move the gripper around the wall to be in front of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and there is no wall between the robot's gripper and the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper and there is a wall between the robot's gripper and the target location, the robot should move the gripper around the wall to be in front of the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper and there is no wall between the robot's gripper and the target location, the robot should slide the puck to the target location.
