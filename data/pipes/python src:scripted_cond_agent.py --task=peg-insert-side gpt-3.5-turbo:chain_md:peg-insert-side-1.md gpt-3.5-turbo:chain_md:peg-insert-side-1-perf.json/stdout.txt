To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line the peg up with the hole
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole

More specifically:
1. First, the robot should position its gripper above the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
2. Next, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper.
   - When the gripper is not around the peg, the robot should drop the gripper around the peg.
3. Then, the robot should line up the peg with the hole.
   - When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
4. Finally, the robot should slide the peg sideways into the hole.
   - When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should slide the peg into the hole.
