    Steps:  1. Put gripper near handle of mug  2. Close gripper around mug handle  3. Pull the mug towards target location
    First, put the gripper near the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle
    If the gripper is near the mug handle and not around it, capture the mug handle by moving the gripper around it and closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug handle is securely in the robot's grip, pull the mug towards the target location.
    - When the mug handle is securely gripped, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
