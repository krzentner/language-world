The task `door-lock` requires the robot to turn the dial on the door.
To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial in the correct direction by applying torque to the dial  3. Continue turning the dial until it reaches the target position
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Determine the direction to turn the dial and apply enough torque to turn it.
    - Determine the direction to turn the dial based on the lock and turn the dial
    Continue turning the dial until it reaches the target position.
    - When the dial is not in the target position, turn the dial until it reaches the target position.
