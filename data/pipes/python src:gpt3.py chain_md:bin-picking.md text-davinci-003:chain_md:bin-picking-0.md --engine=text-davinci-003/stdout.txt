    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Lift cube off ground  5. Move cube to target bin  6. Place cube in target bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube so that the gripper can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close grip around cube.
    We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to lift the cube off the ground.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift cube off ground.
    Now that we've got the cube, move it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding cube, the robot should move cube to target bin.
    When the gripper is above the target bin, it's time to place the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above target bin, the robot should place cube in target bin.
