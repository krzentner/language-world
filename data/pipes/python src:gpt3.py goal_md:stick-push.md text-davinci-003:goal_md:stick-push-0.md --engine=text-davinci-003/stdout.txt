    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Place the stick near the thermos  4. Push the thermos to the target location using the stick
    First, we need to put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the stick is not near the thermos, move the stick near the thermos.
    - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is below the thermos
    If the stick is starting to be near the thermos, push the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the stick is below thermos and the thermos is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the thermos is near the target location
