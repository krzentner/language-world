    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Grab wrench with gripper  3. Rotate the wrench around the peg  4. Tighten the wrench
    First, we need to put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, the robot should grab wrench.
    Now that the gripper is around the wrench, we can rotate it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not around the peg, the robot should rotate wrench around peg.
    Once the wrench is around the peg, tighten it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is around the peg, the robot should tighten the wrench.
