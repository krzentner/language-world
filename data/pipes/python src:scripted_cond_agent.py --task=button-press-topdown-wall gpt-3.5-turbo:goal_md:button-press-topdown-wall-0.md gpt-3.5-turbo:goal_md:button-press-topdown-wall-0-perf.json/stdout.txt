To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the button and below the top of the wall
2. Align gripper with the button
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Push down on the button from the top
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is closed
