To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial by moving towards the dial and closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is near the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
    Turn the dial to the desired position by rotating the gripper in the appropriate direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial to the desired position.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial handle  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial handle and the robot's gripper is lined up with the dial handle, the robot should drop gripper around dial handle.
    Once the gripper is around the dial handle, turn the dial to the desired position. Check the current position of the dial before turning it and make sure it turns in the right direction and to the correct amount.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial handle, the robot should turn the dial to the desired position.
The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific position.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial  2. Turn dial to the target position
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    Turn the dial to the target position. Depending on the direction and distance to turn the dial, the robot should use different levels of force and precision.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn dial to the target position using appropriate force and precision.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the desired position. The amount to turn the dial can be pre-determined or input by the user.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial to the desired position.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the dial  2. Grip the dial  3. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper on the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move the gripper to the dial.
    If the gripper isn't gripping the dial, grip the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial and the gripper is not closed, the robot should close the gripper to grip dial.
    Turn the dial until it reaches the desired position.
    - Turn the dial to the desired position.
