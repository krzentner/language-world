To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos  4. Push the thermos with the stick towards the goal
    First, put the gripper near the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the stick.
    Once the gripper is near the stick, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
    After grabbing the stick, line it up with the thermos by moving the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is not lined up with the thermos, the robot should align the stick with the thermos.
    Push the thermos towards the goal with the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is aligned with the thermos, the robot should push the thermos with the stick towards the goal.
