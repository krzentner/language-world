To pull the peg out from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Move the peg to the side  4. Pull the peg out
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, move the peg to the side to loosen it from its socket.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not moved to the side, move the robot's gripper until the peg is moved to the side
    Finally, pull the peg out of the socket.
    - When the peg is moved to the side, move the robot's gripper until the peg is pulled out of the socket.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the side of the peg  2. Grab the peg with gripper  3. Pull the peg out sideways
    First, put the gripper near the side of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the side of the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the side of the peg
    Once the gripper is near the peg and the peg is grabbed by the gripper, pull the peg out sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper has grabbed the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper has pulled the peg out sideways
To pull the peg out of its socket from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the peg  2. Grab onto the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg sideways out of the socket
    First, put the gripper near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg
    Once the gripper is near the peg, we should grab onto it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull it out of the socket by sliding it sideways. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sideways to the socket
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Move the gripper away from the hole along the peg's axis  4. Slide the peg out of the hole sideways
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg is not fully gripped by the gripper, grab it securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not gripping the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is gripping the peg
    Move the gripper away from the hole along the peg's axis. Then slide the peg out of the hole sideways.
    - When the peg is gripping the gripper and the gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper away from the hole along the peg's axis
    - When the robot's gripper is away from the hole and the peg is not aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is out of the hole sideways.
To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper near the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out to the side
First, put the gripper near the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg
If the gripper is not already around the peg, grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull it out.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper to the side until the peg is released from its socket.
