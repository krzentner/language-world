To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper next to the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper next to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is aligned with the handle, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed around the handle
    With the gripper closed around the handle, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is in the raised position
