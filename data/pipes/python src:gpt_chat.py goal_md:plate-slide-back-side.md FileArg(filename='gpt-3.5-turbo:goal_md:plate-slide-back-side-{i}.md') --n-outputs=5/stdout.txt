To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Bring the gripper over the plate so that it is positioned near the back edge of the plate
4. Move gripper sideways towards the target location while keeping the gripper parallel to the table surface
5. When the plate is almost at the target location, straighten the gripper to make sure the plate is in place
6. Release the plate by opening the gripper

It's important to ensure that the gripper is parallel to the table surface while moving sideways to prevent the plate from tipping over. Also, the gripper needs to be straightened towards the end to make sure that the plate is in place before releasing it.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the target location 4. Lower the gripper and slide the plate back into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the gripper is above the plate, we can grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the target location, we can slide the plate back by moving the gripper above the target location and lowering the gripper to slide the plate back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the target location, we can lower the gripper and slide the plate back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper has lowered enough to slide the plate back into the target location.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate: First, put the gripper roughly above the plate. 

2. Grab the plate with the gripper: Move the gripper down and close it around the plate once the gripper is above the plate.

3. Line the plate up with the target location: Move the gripper to the side of the plate, so that we can slide it back sideways into the target location. 

- When the robot's gripper is not near the side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the side of the plate

4. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location: Once the gripper is to the side of the plate and the plate is lined up with the target location, slide the plate back sideways into the target location.

- When the robot's gripper is lined up with the plate and the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
- Move the gripper horizontally to slide the plate back. 

Note: Be careful not to push too hard and send the plate too far.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once the gripper is lined up above the plate, grab the plate with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    If the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it back sideways into the target location. 
    - When the plate is held securely by the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the plate is back sideways into the target location.
To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper back until the plate is almost at the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location

First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
If the plate is not yet close to the target location, move the gripper and plate back.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not almost at the target location, move the robot's gripper back until the plate is almost at the target location
If the gripper is aligned with the plate and the plate is almost at the target location, we can slide the plate into the target location.
- When the plate is almost at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is lined up with the target location and the gripper is open
If the gripper is lined up with the target location, close the gripper to make sure the plate stays in place.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed.
