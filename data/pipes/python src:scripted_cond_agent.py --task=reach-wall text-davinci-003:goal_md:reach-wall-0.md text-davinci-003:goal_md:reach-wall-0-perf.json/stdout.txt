Steps:  1. Reach to the wall with the gripper  2. Line up the gripper with the target location  3. Move the gripper around the wall  4. Reach to the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall
- When the robot's gripper is near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the target location
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not around the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wall
- When the robot's gripper is around the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
