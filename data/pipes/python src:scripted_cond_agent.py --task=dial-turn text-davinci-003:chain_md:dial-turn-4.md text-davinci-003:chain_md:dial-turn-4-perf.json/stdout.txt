Steps:  1. Pick up the dial eventually with the robot's gripper  2. Move the dial in the intended direction  3. Stop turning when dial is facing the desired position
    When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, we should move the gripper to the dial to eventually pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper to dial.
    If the dial is near the gripper, we can start turning it in the intended direction.
 - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the dial is not facing the desired position, the robot should turn the dial in the intended direction.
    When the dial is facing the desired position, the robot can stop turning.
- When the dial is facing the desired position, the robot should stop turning the dial.
