The steps for performing the `button-press-wall` task are as follows:

1. Put gripper above the button 
2. Line up the gripper with the button as viewed from the side 
3. Drop gripper around the button 
4. Push the button down

The code for performing the `button-press-wall` task would then be as follows:

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the button
    #  2. Line up the gripper with the button as viewed from the side
    #  3. Drop gripper around the button 
    #  4. Push the button down
    # First, put the gripper above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button")
    # If the button is not left of the gripper, move the gripper slightly
    # so the button is left of the gripper.
    if check("the button is not left of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button")
    # If the gripper is near the button but not around it, enclose it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the button, just push it down to press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button")
