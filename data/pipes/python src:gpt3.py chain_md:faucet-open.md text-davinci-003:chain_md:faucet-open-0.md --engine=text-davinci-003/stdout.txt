    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper  3. Start turning the faucet handle left  4. Turn the faucet handle harder
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the faucet handle, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, the robot should put gripper around faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, start turning it left.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle, the robot should turn faucet handle left.
    If the faucet handle is not opening, we can try to turn it harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle and the faucet handle is not opening, the robot should turn faucet left harder.
