To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the hole with enough space to fit the peg
2. Move the gripper down into the hole
3. Close the gripper around the peg
4. Lift the gripper out of the hole
5. Move gripper to target location above the hole
6. Move gripper down to place peg at the target location

- If the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
- If the gripper is not in the hole, move it down into the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
- If the robot's gripper is above the hole, lift the gripper out of the hole
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is lower and aligned with the target location
- If the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper down to the target location
To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg hole  2. Drop gripper into the hole  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Release the peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg hole
    Once the gripper is above the peg hole, drop it into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg hole and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is inside the hole and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper now has a hold on the peg, lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside the hole and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is above the target location
    Move the peg to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed, release the peg.
To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper into the hole, around the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole
    Once the gripper above the hole, put the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Close the gripper around the peg and lift it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is still in the hole, lift the robot's gripper to pull the peg out of the hole and make sure the peg is securely held by the gripper.
    Once the peg is safely in the gripper, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the peg is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
The task `pick-out-of-hole` requires the robot to pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location. To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Lift the peg out of the hole  4. Move the peg to the target location  5. Release the gripper to drop the peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the gripper is not around the peg, put gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg and closed, lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and closed, move the robot's gripper upwards to lift the peg out of the hole
    Once the peg is out of the hole, move the peg to the target location.
    - When the peg is lifted out of the hole, move the robot's gripper to the target location while holding the peg
    Once the robot's gripper is at the target location, release the gripper to drop the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location, release the gripper to drop the peg.
The steps that the robot should perform to pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably are:

1. Put gripper above the peg hole
2. Move the gripper down into the hole until it touches the peg
3. Close the gripper around the peg
4. Lift the gripper out of the hole and move it to the target location
5. Release the peg by opening the gripper

First, put the gripper above the peg hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg hole
Once the gripper is lined up with the peg, move it down into the hole until it touches the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and is not near the peg hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and is inside the hole
Close the gripper around the peg to pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and is not closed, close the gripper around the peg
Lift the gripper out of the hole and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the peg and is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
Release the peg by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and is not open, open the gripper to release the peg.
