    Steps:  1. Put gripper beneath handle  2. Grab the handle with gripper  3. Push up on the handle 
    First, put the gripper beneath the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can just pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Grab the handle  3. Rise the gripper to lift the handle
    First, the robot should put its gripper above the handle and then drop it around the handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is closed 
    When the robot's gripper is in front of the handle, grab it by closing the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle.
    After the robot's gripper is above the handle, the robot can just rise the gripper to lift the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull handle up
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle, so that we can align it properly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, just pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper below handle  2. Grab handle with gripper  3. Pull up handle
    First, put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    By grabbing the handle with the gripper, we can easily pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper below handle  2. Pull up the handle
    First, we should put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is lined up below the handle, we can pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
