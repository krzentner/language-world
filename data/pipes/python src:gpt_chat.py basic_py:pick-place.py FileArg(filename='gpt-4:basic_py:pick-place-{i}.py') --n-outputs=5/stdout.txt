I'm sorry, it seems like there was a duplication of the pick_place function in the code snippet you provided earlier. Here is the full list of functions and their descriptions: 

- reach: reach to the target location
- push: slide the puck to the target location
- pick_place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
- door_open: pull the door open
- drawer_open: pull the drawer open
- drawer_close: push the drawer close
- button_press_topdown: push the button down from above
- peg_insert_side: insert the peg into the hole from the side
- window_open: slide the window open to the left
- window_close: slide the window closed to the right

Is there anything else I can help you with?

I'm sorry, but you had already defined the "pick_place" function above. Did you mean to write a different function, or did you have a specific question about the "pick_place" function?
