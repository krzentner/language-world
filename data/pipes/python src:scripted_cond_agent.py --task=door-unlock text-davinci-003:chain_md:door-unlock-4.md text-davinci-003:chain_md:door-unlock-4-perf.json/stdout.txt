    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the dial  2.Grab the dial with the gripper  3.Adjust the dial to the correct position 
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    If the dial isn't to the left of the gripper, rotate it left so it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and dial is not left of robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper over dial.
    Once the gripper is over the dial, grab it by closing the gripper. Then adjust the dial to the right position.
    - When the robot's gripper is over the dial and the gripper is closed, the robot should adjust the dial to the correct position.
