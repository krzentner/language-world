To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck towards wall, stopping before the wall  4. Move gripper to above the wall  5. Drop the gripper over the puck  6. Slide the puck to the goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it. But if the puck is near the wall, stop before touching the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should slide the puck towards the wall, but stop before it.
    If the gripper is near the wall, move it above the wall so that it hovers over the puck on the other side of the wall.
    - When the gripper is above the wall and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper over the puck from above the wall.
    If the gripper is around the puck and not near the goal, move the gripper towards the goal to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the goal and gripping the puck, the robot should slide the puck into the goal.
