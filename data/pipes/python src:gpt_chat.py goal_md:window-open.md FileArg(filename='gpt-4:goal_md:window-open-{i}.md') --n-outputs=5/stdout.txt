Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the window open to the left reliably:

1. Put the gripper right of the window handle.
2. Move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the window handle.
3. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
4. Push the window open harder.
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the window open to the left reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle 
    Move the robot's gripper to the right of the window handle so that it can start pushing against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle, the robot can start pushing against it.
    - Push the window handle to the left
Please see the steps below for the task `window-open`:
    
    1. Put gripper right of the window handle
    We need to position the gripper to the right of the window handle to be able to push it to slide open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the window handle, while still to the right of it.
    Once the gripper is in position, we can start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
    - When the robot's gripper is in position, start pushing against the window handle to slide it open to the left.
    If the window doesn't slide open easily, push harder until it does.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing the window handle, push harder until the window slides open to the left.
Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window open to the left reliably:

1. Put the gripper right of the window handle.
2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
3. Push the window open harder.

If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, it should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
4. When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle.
If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, it can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
5. When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle.
