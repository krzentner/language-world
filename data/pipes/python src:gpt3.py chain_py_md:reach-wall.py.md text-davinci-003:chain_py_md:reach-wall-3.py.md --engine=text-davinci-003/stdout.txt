Here's the program:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach around the wall to the target location
    # We need to move the robot's gripper around the wall, so first we should
    # move the gripper to the side of the wall, so that it won't interfere with
    # our reach.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the side of the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to side of wall")
    # Now, move the gripper to the target location, making sure it goes around
    # the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the side of the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the target location"):
        robot.reach("around the wall to the target location")
```
