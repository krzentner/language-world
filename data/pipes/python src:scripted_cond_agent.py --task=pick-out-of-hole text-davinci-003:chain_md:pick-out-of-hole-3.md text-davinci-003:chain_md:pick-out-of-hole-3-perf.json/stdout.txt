    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Reach with gripper into the hole  3. Grab the peg  4. Lift peg and move to goal
    First, the robot should place the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should put gripper above hole.
    Then, the robot should reach with the gripper into the hole to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is not in the hole, the robot should reach with gripper into hole.
    If the gripper is in the hole, close it around the peg to pick it up. 
    - When the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
    Now that the robot has the peg, it can lift it and move the peg to the target goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around peg, the robot should move peg to goal.
