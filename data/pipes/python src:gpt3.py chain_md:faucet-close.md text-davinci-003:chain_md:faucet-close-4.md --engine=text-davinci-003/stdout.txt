    Steps:  1. Put gripper above faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around faucet handle  3. Turn faucet right
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, we should be able to grab the faucet handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, the robot should put gripper around faucet handle.
    Now that the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can just turn the faucet right.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle, the robot should turn faucet right.
