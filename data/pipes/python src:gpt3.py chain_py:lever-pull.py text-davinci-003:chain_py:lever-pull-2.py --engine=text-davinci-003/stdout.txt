    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lever
    #  2. Grab the lever
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # First, put the gripper above the lever.

    # If the lever is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper

    # Because the lever is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with
    # it from the front instead of around it.

    # rotated up, rotate the lever up.

        robot.rotate("lever up")
