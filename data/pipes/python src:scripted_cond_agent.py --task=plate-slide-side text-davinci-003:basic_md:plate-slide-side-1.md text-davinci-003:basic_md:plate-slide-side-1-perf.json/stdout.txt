    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is below the plate, the robot should move gripper to right of plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should slide plate to side in order to move it into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the plate, the robot should push plate harder to move it into the target location.
