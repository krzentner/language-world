To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

   Steps:  1. Put gripper around the button  2. Move the gripper close to the button  3. Press the button from the front by moving the gripper forward
    First, put the gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the button and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not close to the button, move the gripper closer.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    If there is a short wall in the way, push the gripper forward to press the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button and the robot's gripper is closed
