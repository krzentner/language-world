    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should reach target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the puck is not near the wall, the robot should move the gripper slightly away from the wall and push the puck against the wall to get around it.
    - When the puck is close enough to the wall, the robot should use its gripper to nudge the puck around the wall and slide it to the goal.
