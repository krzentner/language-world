To grab the mug and move it to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Drop gripper around the mug handle and lift the mug  3. Move the gripper to the target location  4. Lower the mug to the target location and release the gripper
First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should put the gripper above the mug handle.
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the handle and lift the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the mug handle and lift the mug.
Move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and is not above the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
Lower the mug to the target location and release the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and holding the mug, the robot should lower the mug to the target location and release the gripper.
