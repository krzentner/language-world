Steps:
 1. Reach towards the wall
 2. Move the gripper up, over the wall
 3. Reach towards the target

We need to start by moving towards the wall. The first move while reaching towards the wall should be slightly steeper than the move towards the target location.

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the wall
    #  2. Move the gripper up, over the wall
    #  3. Reach towards the target
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall", steeper=True)
```

Now that the robot is near the wall, the robot can move it's gripper over the wall and towards the target location.

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the wall
    #  2. Move the gripper up, over the wall
    #  3. Reach towards the target
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall", steeper=True)
    # Move the gripper above the wall, so that it can reach over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is at the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    # Now that the gripper is above the wall, move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


Once the gripper is near the wall, the robot should reach around it.

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the wall
    #  2. Reach around the wall
    #  3. Reach to the target
    # 
    # First, reach towards the wall. We don't have any objects to manipulate, so
    # we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
    # Now that the gripper is near the wall, position the gripper so that it is
    # parallel to the wall and reach around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not parallel to the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("parallel to the wall")
    # Now that the gripper is parallel to the wall, move it around the wall to
    # the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the target"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the wall to the target")


The robot needs to be able to reach through a wall in order to complete this task.

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target location
    #  2. Push the wall
    #  3. Reach past the wall
    # We will need to maneuver around a wall to get to the target location. 
    # First we reach towards the target location. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
    # To get past the wall, we need to move the gripper to the top of the wall,
    # pushing gently until it moves.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the wall")
    # Now we can slide the gripper past the wall and reach the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the target"):
        robot.move_gripper("past the wall")


To perform the task `reach-wall`, the robot will need to perform a few steps. First, the robot needs to move its gripper vertically aligned with the target wall and then move laterally until the gripper is above the target location. Once the gripper is above the target location, the robot can slowly lower the gripper to reach it.

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper in front of the short wall and vertically aligned with the wall
    #  2. Move the gripper to the right or left until it is above the target location
    #  3. Move the gripper slowly downward until it reaches the target location
    # First, put the gripper in front of the short wall and vertically aligned 
    # with the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the wall")
    # Now that the gripper is in front of the wall, we can move it laterally until 
    # it is above of the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
    # Lastly, we can slowly move the gripper downward until it reaches the 
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


The robot should grab onto the wall and then reach to the target location.

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the wall
    #  2. Grab onto the wall with the gripper
    #  3. Reach towards the target
    
    # We want to grab onto the wall first, so we need to make sure the gripper is
    # near it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
    # Once the gripper is near the wall, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
    # Closing the gripper will also help stabilize the robot's movement.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the wall and closed, the robot should have a good
    # grip. Now it can move towards the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target")
