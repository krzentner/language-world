To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Close gripper around soccer ball  4. Push the ball towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it towards the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper and the soccer ball are horizontally aligned with the target location. Then, move the robot's gripper towards the target location to push the soccer ball.
