To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the plate  2. Move the gripper towards the plate  3. Push the plate to the target location
    First, place the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, move it towards the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper towards the plate.
    If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, move the gripper down to the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should push the plate towards the target location.
The robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper into plate  3. Slide plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is not pressed against the plate, move the gripper down to the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper is not pressed against the plate, the robot should push the gripper into the plate.
    If the gripper is near the goal, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure that we keep control of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.
To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper down onto plate  3. Slide plate to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is not pushing down onto the plate, push down onto the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not pushing down onto the plate, the robot should push down onto the plate.
    Once the gripper is pushing down onto the plate, slide the plate to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing down onto the plate, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.
To slide the plate into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper into top of plate  3. Slide plate to goal
The robot can slide the plate by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the plate isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not above plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, move the gripper down to the plate to slide it.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, the robot should push the gripper into the plate.
If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.
To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Put gripper around plate  3. Lift the plate to avoid obstruction  4. Slide the plate to the goal  5. Lower the plate to rest on goal surface
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    If the gripper is not already around the plate, move the gripper around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate, the robot should put gripper around the plate.
    Lift the plate enough to clear any obstructions as the plate is being slid.
    - When the robot's gripper has the plate and is not lifted enough, the robot should lift the plate.
    Slide the plate towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper has the plate and the plate is not at goal location, the robot should slide the plate.
    Lower the plate to rest on the goal surface.
    - When the plate reaches the goal location, the robot should lower the plate to rest on the goal surface.
