To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should place the gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move its gripper down towards the button and make contact with it.
- When the robot's gripper is holding down the button, the robot should push the button downwards with enough force to trigger it.
