First, the robot should bring its gripper as close as possible to the object. The smallest distance and angle between the robot and the object will improve accuracy of the robotâ€™s movements. 

Steps:  1. Move the robot's gripper as close as possible to the object  2. Grab the object  3. Move the object towards the bin  4. Release the object into the bin
- When the robot's gripper is not near the object, the robot should move gripper as close as possible to the object. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the object and the gripper is still open, the robot should grab the object. 
- When the robot's gripper is closed and the object is still near the gripper, the robot should move object towards bin. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the bin and the object is close to the bin, the robot should release object into the bin.
