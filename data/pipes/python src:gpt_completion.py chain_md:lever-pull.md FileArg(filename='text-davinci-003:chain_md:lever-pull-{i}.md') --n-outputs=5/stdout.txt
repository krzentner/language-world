    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever  2. Grab the lever with the gripper  3. Push the lever upward  4. Rotate the lever up
    First, line the gripper up above the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    Once the gripper is lined up, grab the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab lever.
    Now that the gripper is grabbing the lever from the top, we just need to rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should rotate lever up.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Rotate the lever up  3. Pull the lever up
    First, put the robot's gripper above the lever so that we can twist it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    If the gripper is lined up with the lever, we can rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever and lever is not rotated up, the robot should rotate lever up.
    If the lever is partially up, keep going up and lift.
    - When lever is partially up, the robot should pull lever up.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Grab lever with gripper  3. Pull up on the lever
    First, put grasper above the lever so that the robot can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    If the lever isn't left of the gripper, move the gripper left to start to grab the lever.
    - When the lever is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, the robot should put gripper around lever.
    Once we have the gripper around the lever, pull up on the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, the robot should pull up on lever.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near lever  2. Grasp lever close to the base  3. Pull lever up
    We need to put the gripper near the lever before we can grab it, to have enough space to rotate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the lever, the robot should place gripper near lever.
    We need to grab the lever close to the base, because we're rotating it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is not close to the base, the robot should grab lever close to base.
    When the gripper is close to the base, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the base, the robot should pull lever up.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper beneath the lever  2. Raise grip up  3. Pull up lever
    First, put the gripper as close as possible to the underside of the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beneath lever, the robot should put gripper beneath lever.
    Now that the gripper is beneath the lever, raise the gripper up and try to get it in front of the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the lever, the robot should raise gripper up.
    As long as the gripper is still below the lever, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the lever, the robot should pull up lever.
