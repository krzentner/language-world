To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot approaches the thermos, the robot should put the stick in front of the thermos and orient it parallel to the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick and the gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper near the stick and close its gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is in front of the thermos, the robot should push the stick towards the target location.
- While pushing the stick, the robot should watch the thermos and ensure that the thermos is moving.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the stick and place the thermos at the goal location.
