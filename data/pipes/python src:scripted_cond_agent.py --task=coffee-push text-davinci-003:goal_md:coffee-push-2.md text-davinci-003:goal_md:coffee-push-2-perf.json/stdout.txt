    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the mug  2. Lift the mug up with the gripper  3. Move the mug to the target location 
    First, we should put the gripper around the mug.
    -When the robot's gripper is not around mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot's gripper is around the mug, lift the mug up with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the mug is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    Last, move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
