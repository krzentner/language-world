    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line up the plate with the target location  4. Slide the plate into its target location
    First, put the gripper left of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not around the plate, put it around the plate by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the plate is lined up with the target location, slide it into the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is lined up with its target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
