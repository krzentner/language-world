Steps:
1. Place the gripper left of the handle 
2. Wrap the gripper around the handle
3. Pull the handle up

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Place the gripper left of the handle 
    #  2. Wrap the gripper around the handle
    #  3. Pull the handle up
    # To pull the handle up from the side, the gripper needs to be left of the
    # handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the handle")
    # If the gripper is in the correct position, wrap it around the handle and
    # make sure it's closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the robot's gripper is around the handle and closed, pull up the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the handle")


Then complete the task:

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Step:
    #  1. Put gripper below handle
    #  2. Grab handle with gripper
    #  3. Pull up handle
    # Put the gripper below the handle so that we don't have to line up the gripper precisely.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is below the handle and the gripper is open,
    # we can grab the handle by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is not closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
    # If the handle is trapped, we can pull it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the handle")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper left of the handle
2. Drop gripper around the handle
3. Pull up the handle

If the robot's gripper is not near the handle, we need to put the robot's gripper near it to be able to grab the handle.

if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("left of the handle")

If the gripper is not around the handle, drop the gripper around it.

if check("the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the handle", close_gripper=True)

Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull up the handle.

if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
    robot.move_gripper("up of the handle")


The program should be:
```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near handle
    #  2. Grip handle
    #  3. Pull handle up
    # First, put the gripper near the handle, so that we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
    # If the gripper is near the handle but not gripping it, close the gripper
    # to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can pull it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the handle")
 ```


Steps:
1. Put gripper near the handle
2. Grab the handle with the gripper
3. Pull up the handle

 
```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the handle
    #  2. Grab the handle with the gripper
    #  3. Pull up the handle
    # Move the gripper near the handle
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the handle")
    # Grab the handle by closing the gripper around it
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("completely around the handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is locked around the handle, pull up the handle
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the handle")
