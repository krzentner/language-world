    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, the robot should move gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not near handle, the robot should push gripper towards handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should push handle down.
