I believe you have copy-pasted the code for window-open instead of window-close. Here's the correct code for window-close:

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
I think there might be a duplicate function here, as this is the exact same code for `window-open` as earlier. Did you mean to write a different function for this task?
Oops, it looks like the function for opening the window was already defined above. Here's the correct code for the "window-close" function:

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
# def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
I believe we already have a function for sliding the window open to the left named `window_open`. Did you mean to ask me for something else?
I'm sorry, it looks like this function has already been defined above. Is there anything else I can help you with?
