    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the top of the wall  2. Place gripper above puck  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper on top of the wall near the puck. This will allow the robot to drop the puck around the wall when it's time to grab it, since the gripping axis of the robot's gripper should be perpendicular to the direction it moves in. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the top of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the top of the wall
    Then, put the gripper above the puck so that we can easily manipulate it without having to account for the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the puck and closed, we've likely trapped the puck and can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
