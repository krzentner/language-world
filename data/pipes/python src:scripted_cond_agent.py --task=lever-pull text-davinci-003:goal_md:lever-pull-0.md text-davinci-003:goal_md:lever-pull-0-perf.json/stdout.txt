    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Pull lever up
    As with all of these tasks, we always want to start by getting our gripper in the right location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
    If the gripper is above the lever, grab it by pushing the gripper down against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we have the lever, just pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the lever has rotated to the desired orientation
