The robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should move gripper to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, the robot should push the door closed to the goal.
    - When the door is nearing the target location and needs more force, the robot should push the door closed harder.
