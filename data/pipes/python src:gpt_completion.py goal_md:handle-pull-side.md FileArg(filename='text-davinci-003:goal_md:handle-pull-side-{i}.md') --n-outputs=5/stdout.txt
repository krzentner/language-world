    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Lift the handle up  4. Pull the handle out to the side
    First, put the robot's gripper above the handle, so that we can grab it without any obstacles.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is above the handle, we should be able to grab it by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once gripping the handle with the gripper, lift the handle up and out to the side to take it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is not out of the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the handle is out of the hole

    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the handle  2. Grab onto the handle  3. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once we're sure the gripper is aligned with the handle, it's safe to put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is below the handle and closed, we should be able to grab onto the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and move the robot's gripper up

    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the side of the handle  2. Rotationally move gripper onto handle  3. Pull up the handle with the gripper 
    If the robotâ€™s gripper is not on the side of the handle, we should move the gripper near the handle  
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the handle, we can rotate the gripper to put it onto the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    If the robot's gripper is around the handle, we can pull up the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper underneath the handle  2. Move gripper slightly left of the handle  3. Pull the handle up 
    Because we're pulling up, the gripper should be placed below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle 
    If the gripper is still not left of the handle, the gripper should be moved left of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the handle 
    When the gripper is left of the handle, pull the handle up
    - When the robot's gripper is left of handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle

    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle 2. Grab the handle with the gripper 3. Pull up the handle
    First, we should put the gripper above the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is not aligned with the gripper, we should line up the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is not in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the handle is in front of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the handle is in front of the gripper, grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Now that the gripper is securely holding the handle, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot is pulling up on the handle
