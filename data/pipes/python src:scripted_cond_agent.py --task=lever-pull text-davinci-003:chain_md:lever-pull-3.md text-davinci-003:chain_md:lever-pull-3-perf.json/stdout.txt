    Steps:  1. Put gripper near lever  2. Grasp lever close to the base  3. Pull lever up
    We need to put the gripper near the lever before we can grab it, to have enough space to rotate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the lever, the robot should place gripper near lever.
    We need to grab the lever close to the base, because we're rotating it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is not close to the base, the robot should grab lever close to base.
    When the gripper is close to the base, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the base, the robot should pull lever up.
