The robot should perform the following steps to push the button from the front with a short wall in the way:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper to wall  2. Move gripper along wall to button height  3. Push button from the front
    First, move the gripper towards the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the wall.
    Once the gripper is at the wall, move it to the proper height of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the proper height of the button, the robot should move the gripper along the wall to the proper height of the button.
    Now that the gripper is at the proper height and location, push the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the proper height of the button, the robot should push the button from the front.
