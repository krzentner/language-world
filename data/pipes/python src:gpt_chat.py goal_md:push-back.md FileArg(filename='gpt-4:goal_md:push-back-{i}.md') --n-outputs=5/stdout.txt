Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the puck backwards to the target location:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck backwards to goal
    The difference from the `push` task is that we now need to slide the puck backwards. The robot can still grip the puck from above and slide it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper backwards until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck. 2. Push gripper into top of puck. 3. Slide puck away from the goal. 4. Slide the puck towards the target location.
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards away from the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is opposite to the target location. While doing that, slide the puck away from the goal.
    If the puck has been slide away from the goal and the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location, slide the puck towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while sliding the puck towards the target location.
To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the puck
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Slide the puck backwards to the goal
   - If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
     - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
   - If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
     - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open (to release the puck)
To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into bottom of puck  3. Slide puck backwards to the goal
    The robot can slide the puck backwards by trapping it and pushing down on it from below and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down towards the puck to slide it backwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the target location
To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Slide puck backwards to goal

The same steps as `push`, but instead of moving the puck to the left or right, we move it backwards towards the target location. We need to make sure the gripper is above the puck, put the gripper around the puck if it isn't already there, and then slide the puck backwards to the goal.
