To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is below the robot's gripper, the robot should pull the mug towards the target location while maintaining a secure grip on the handle with the gripper.
