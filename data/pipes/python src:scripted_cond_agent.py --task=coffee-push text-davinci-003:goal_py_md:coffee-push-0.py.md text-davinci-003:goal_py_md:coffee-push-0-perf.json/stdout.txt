Steps:
1. Put gripper above mug handle
2. Drop gripper around mug handle
3. Slide mug to the target location

    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the mug handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the mug handle, we should be able to
    # grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the mug handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can just move the mug
    # to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
