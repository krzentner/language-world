    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Drop gripper around the button  3. Push down on the button
    We need to line up the robot's gripper before we can push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    If the gripper is almost lined up with the button, grab it by dropping the gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not around the button, the robot should drop gripper around button.
    Now that the gripper is around the button, we can push it by pushing down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around button, the robot should push down on button.
