Steps:  1. Move gripper to the side of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out sideways  4. Move the peg away from the hole
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move gripper to the side of peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the pegs is still inside the hole, the robot should pull peg out sideways.
- When the peg is outside the hole, the robot should move peg away from the hole.


Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab peg with gripper  3. Pull peg sidewards to unplug it  4. Lift peg out
    First, put the robot's gripper above the peg and adjust it so that it is just above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    Once the gripper is above the peg, move it down to the peg so that we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should grab peg.
    Now that the gripper is around the peg, we can begin to unplug it. Pull the peg sidewards and slowly out of the hole. 
    -  When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is still plugged into the hole, the robot should pull peg sidewards to unplug it.
    Once the peg is somewhat unplugged, lift it out of the hole so that it is completely removed.
    - When peg is unplugged and peg is still in the hole, the robot should lift peg out.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg sideways out 
    We need to put the gripper above the peg before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg is below the gripper as seen from the front, move the gripper around the peg (but don't close the gripper yet).
    - When peg is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab peg.
    Now that the gripper is around the peg, pull the peg straight out from the side, i.e., pull the peg away from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull peg out sideways.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper aside of the peg  2. Pull peg sideways away from the hole  3. Move peg away from the hole
    First, move the gripper towards the side of the peg to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beside peg, the robot should put gripper aside of peg.
    Now that the gripper is beside the peg, pull sideways to unplug the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is beside peg and the peg is still in the hole, the robot should pull peg sideways away from hole.
    Once the peg is out of the hole, move it away.
    - When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move peg away from hole.

    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed sideways  2. Lift the peg out  3. Pull the peg out
    First, line up the gripper with the side of the peg. We don't need to be exact, just line it up roughly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not laterally aligned with the peg, the robot should line up gripper along side of peg.
    Once we're roughly aligned, we can lift it out by slowly moving the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is laterally aligned with the peg and the peg is still inside the hole, the robot should lift the peg out.
    Once the peg comes out a little, we can pull it out.
    - When the robot's gripper is laterally aligned with the peg and the peg is out of the hole, the robot should pull peg out.
