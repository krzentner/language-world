To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pulled up completely.
The robot should perform the following steps to pull up the handle:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle has been pulled up
The following steps could be taken to pull up the handle reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the handle  2. Grip the handle and pull upwards
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the handle and aligned with it, grip the handle and pull it upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper upwards while keeping hold of the handle
For the `handle-pull` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle upwards
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, pull it upwards to complete the task.
To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the gripper is not yet gripping the handle, position the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, just pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is fully pulled up.
