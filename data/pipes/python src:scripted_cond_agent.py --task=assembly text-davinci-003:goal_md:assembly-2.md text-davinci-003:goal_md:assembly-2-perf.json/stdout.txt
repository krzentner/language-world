    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the peg  2. Put the motion of the gripper near the peg  3. Put the motion of the gripper around the peg  4. Put the wrench around the peg  5. Close the grip of the robot
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper isn't near the peg, move it near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg
    Put the gripper's motion around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open
    Put the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
