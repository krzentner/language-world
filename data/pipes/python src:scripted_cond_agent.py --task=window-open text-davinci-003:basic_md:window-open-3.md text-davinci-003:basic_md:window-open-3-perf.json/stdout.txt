The robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window left.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window left harder.
