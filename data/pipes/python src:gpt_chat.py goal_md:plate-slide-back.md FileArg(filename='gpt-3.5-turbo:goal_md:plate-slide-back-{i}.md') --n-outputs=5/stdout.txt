To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper into top of plate to trap it  3. Slide plate back to target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Start sliding the gripper down on top of the plate to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not touching the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the plate
    Once the gripper is on top of the plate, we can slide it back to the target location. If the plate isn't aligned with the gripper, move the gripper to align it.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the plate and the plate is not aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is aligned with the target location
    If the gripper is near the target location now, we can slide the plate into place.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open.
To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
Steps: 1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with gripper  3. Slide plate back to target location  4. Release plate
First, put the robot's gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
If the robot's gripper is not holding the plate, grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the target location, slide it back to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the target location is in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location with the plate
Finally, release the plate.
- When the plate is in the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the plate, release the plate.
To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the plate
    2. Put the gripper around the plate
    3. Lift the plate slightly to reduce friction with the surface
    4. Slide the plate back to the target location
    When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate but not around it, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around it and the robot's gripper is closed.
    To reduce the friction with the surface, lift the plate slightly.
    - Lift the plate slightly using the robot's gripper
    After reducing the friction, slide the plate back to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate touches the target location.
To slide the plate back into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Lift the plate off the table  4. Move gripper to target location  5. Slide the plate onto the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate or open, move it near and close it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate but not near it, or the robot's gripper is open but above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper has grabbed the plate, lift it off the table.
    - When the robot's gripper has the plate but is not lifted off the table, lift the plate off the table
    Move the gripper holding the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Slide the plate off the gripper and onto the target location.
    - Once the robot's gripper is above the target location, slide the plate onto the target location
To slide the plate back reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Approach the plate  2. Move the gripper under the plate  3. Lift the plate up  4. Move the plate back to the target location  5. Lower the plate onto the target location
    First, approach the plate to get closer to it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    Once the gripper is near the plate, move it under the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not under the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is under the plate
    Now that the gripper is under the plate, lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is under the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is not yet at the target location while the gripper is closed, move the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the plate is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper and the plate until the plate is above the target location
    Finally, lower the plate onto the target location.
    - When the plate is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and the plate is on the target location
