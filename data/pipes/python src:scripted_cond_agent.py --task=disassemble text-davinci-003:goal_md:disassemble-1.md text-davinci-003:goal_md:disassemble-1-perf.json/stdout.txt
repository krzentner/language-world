    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the peg  2. Grab the wrench  3. Pull the wrench back with the gripper
    The robot should put the gripper above the peg and try to grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper is already around the wrench, let's start pulling the wrench off with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the wrench and closed, we've probably trapped the wrench and can pull it back.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the peg
