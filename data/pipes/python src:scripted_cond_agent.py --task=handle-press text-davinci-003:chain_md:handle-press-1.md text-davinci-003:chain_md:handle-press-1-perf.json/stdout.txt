    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper     3. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, grab it by dropping the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle we can just push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should push handle down.
