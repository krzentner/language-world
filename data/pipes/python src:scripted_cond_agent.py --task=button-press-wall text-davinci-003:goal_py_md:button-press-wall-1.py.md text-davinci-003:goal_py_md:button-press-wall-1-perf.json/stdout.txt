Steps:
  1. Put gripper left of the button
  2. Push the wall away with the gripper
  3. Line the gripper up with the button
  4. Push down on the button from the front

If the robot's gripper is not left of the button, it should move it there.
We’re working around the wall, so make sure the robot’s gripper is in front of the wall.
