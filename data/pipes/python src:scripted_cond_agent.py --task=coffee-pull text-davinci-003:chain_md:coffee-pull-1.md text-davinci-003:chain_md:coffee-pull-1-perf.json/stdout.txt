    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Grab mug with gripper  3. Close gripper around mug  4. Lift mug up with gripper  5. Pull mug to target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug, the robot should place gripper above mug.
    Once the gripper is above the mug, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug.
    Now that the mug is in the gripper, we can lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around mug and the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should lift mug up with gripper.
    Lastly, pull it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is below the robot's gripper, the robot should pull mug to target location.
