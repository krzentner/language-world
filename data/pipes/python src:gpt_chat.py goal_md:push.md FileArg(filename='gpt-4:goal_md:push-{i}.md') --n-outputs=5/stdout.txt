Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
The robot should perform the following steps to slide the puck to the target location:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the top of the puck
3. Close the gripper around the puck
4. Move the gripper and puck towards the target location
5. Once the gripper and puck are near the target location, release the gripper to release control of the puck.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck 
2. Push gripper into top of puck 
3. Slide puck to goal

The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck

If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed

If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the puck to the target location:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Slide puck to goal
4. If the gripper is not above the puck and not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until it is vertically aligned with the puck and above it
5. If the gripper is not around the puck and open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the puck and closed
6. If the gripper is near the puck and closed, move the robot's gripper until it is above the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Move the gripper down around the puck
3. Close the gripper around the puck
4. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the puck
5. If the gripper is not near the puck, move the gripper until it is near the puck and closed
6. Slide the gripper down to trap the puck
7. Move the gripper towards the target location while keeping the puck trapped
8. If the gripper is not above the target location, move the gripper until it is above the target location
9. Release the puck by opening the gripper at the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Slide puck to goal

First, put the gripper above the puck so that we can trap it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
