    Steps:  1. Put gripper near handle  2. Line handle up with gripper as viewed from the side  3. Pull the handle up 
    First, put the gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move the gripper near the handle.
    As long as the handle and gripper are roughly in the same plane, we can align it with the gripper viewing it from the side.
    - When handle is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should put handle in horizontal alignment with gripper. 
    Now that the handle is lined up with the gripper, just start pulling it up.
    - When handle is horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should pull handle.
