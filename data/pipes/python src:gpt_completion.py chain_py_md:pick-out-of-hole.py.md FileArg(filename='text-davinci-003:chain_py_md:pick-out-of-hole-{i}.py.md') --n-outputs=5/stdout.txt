The answer is:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole
    #  2. Drop gripper in hole
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    #  4. Lift peg out of hole
    #  5. Move peg to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the hole so we can drop the gripper into the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    # Once the gripper is above the hole we can drop it in after making sure it's
    # open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("the gripper into the hole")
    # If the gripper is around the peg, close the gripper around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the peg")
    # Now that the peg is held in the gripper, we can lift it out of the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the peg out of the hole")
    # Finally, move the peg to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("peg at goal")
```


Here's the program:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole 
    #  2. Drop gripper around peg
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    #  4. Pull peg out of hole
    #  5. Place peg at goal
    # Start by positioning the gripper above the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    # If the gripper is not around the peg, drop the gripper around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is near the peg, close the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is closed and near the peg, try to pull the peg out of the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the peg and the robot's gripper is connected to the peg"):
        robot.pull("peg out of the hole")
    # If the peg is out of the hole, place it at the goal location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the peg is out of the hole"):
        robot.place("peg at goal")
```


The Steps:
 1. Put the gripper above and to the side of the hole
 2. Angle the gripper downwards
 3. Reach into the hole
 4. Grab the peg with the gripper
 5. Lift the gripper out of the hole, with the peg
 6. Move the peg to the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole and to the side of the hole"):
    robot.put("gripper above and to the side of the hole")

if check("the robot's gripper is above the hole and to the side of the hole"):   
    robot.angle("gripper downwards")

if check("the robot's gripper is angled downwards towards the hole"):
    robot.reach("into the hole")

if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg in the hole"):
    robot.grab("peg with the gripper")

if check("the peg is in the robot's gripper"):
    robot.lift("gripper out of hole, with the peg")

if check("the robot's gripper is out of the hole with the peg"):
    robot.place("peg at target location")


The program would look like this:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole
    #  2. Drop griper around peg
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    #  4. Move peg out of hole
    # First, put the gripper above the hole, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above the hole")
    # If the gripper is not around the peg, put it around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is near the peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    # We closed the gripper, the peg should still be near the gripper, so let's
    # try to move the peg out of the hole.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("peg out of the hole")
```


The program should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the hole
2. Drop gripper around the peg
3. Grab the peg with the gripper
4. Move the peg to the target location

```

    #  3. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  4. Move the peg to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    # If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is near the peg and open, grab the peg by closing the 
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    # We closed the gripper, and the peg is still near the gripper, so we've 
    # probably grabbed it.
    # Try to move the peg to the target location.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("peg at target location")
```
