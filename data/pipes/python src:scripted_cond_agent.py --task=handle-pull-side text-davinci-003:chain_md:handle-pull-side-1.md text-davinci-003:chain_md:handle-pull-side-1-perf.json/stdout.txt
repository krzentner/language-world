    Steps:  1. Put gripper alongside the handle  2. Pull up on the handle  3. Pull harder until handle is released
    Put the gripper alongside the handle so that the handle is between the gripper and the edge of the surface.
    - When the robot's gripper is not alongside the handle, the robot should put gripper alongside handle.
    If the handle is between the gripper and the edge of the surface, the gripper can pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is alongside the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle.
    If the handle is still connected, pull harder on the handle until it is released.
    - When the robot's gripper is alongside handle and the handle is not released, the robot should pull harder on handle.
