    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hammer  2. Drop gripper around the hammer  3. Swing the hammer downwards onto the nail  4. Pull the hammer back up
    First, put the gripper roughly above the hammer so that it can grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer
    If the gripper isn't around the hammer, put it around the hammer. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the hammer
    Now that the gripper is around the hammer, we can swing it downwards to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is vertically aligned with the nail
    After hitting the nail, slowly pull back the hammer, so that we can hammer the nail in securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is above the nail
