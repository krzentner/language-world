    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial
    If the dial isn't under the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not near dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the dial and open, we should be able to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper to turn the dial
