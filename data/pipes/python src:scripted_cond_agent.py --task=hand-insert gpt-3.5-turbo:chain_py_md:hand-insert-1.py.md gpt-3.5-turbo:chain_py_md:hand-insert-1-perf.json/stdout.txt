# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
# def hand_insert(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the puck
    #  2. Open gripper around puck

    # This task is similar to pick-place, but instead of placing the puck at the
    # target location, we just need to move it there.

    # Once the gripper is around the puck, move the gripper and puck to the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):

    # puck.
