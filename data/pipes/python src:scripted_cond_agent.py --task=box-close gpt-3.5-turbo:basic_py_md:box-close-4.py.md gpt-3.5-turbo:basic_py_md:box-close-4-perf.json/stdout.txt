Sure thing! Here's a program to perform the `box-close` task:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.place("gripper above box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on box")
``` 

Note that the `check` function is not defined in the provided code, so you would need to define it yourself or use a different method to check the robot's position and state. Additionally, this code assumes that the robot knows the location of the box and its lid. If the robot needs to first locate the box and/or lid, additional code would need to be added to the program.
