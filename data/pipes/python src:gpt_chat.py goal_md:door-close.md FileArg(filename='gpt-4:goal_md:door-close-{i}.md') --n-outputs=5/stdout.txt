To push the door closed to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle.
To push the door closed to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the edge of the door  2. Push the door closed to the target location
    If the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the door, move the gripper near the edge of the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the edge of the door
    If the robot's gripper is aligned with the door from the front, we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the door from the front, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the edge of the door. 
    Once the robot's gripper is around the edge of the door, we can push it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the edge of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is facing towards the target location and the robot's gripper is closed. Then push the door until it reaches the target location.
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly near the door handle  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly in the middle of the door  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door, move it to the middle of the door. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door
    If the gripper is roughly in the middle of the door, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is roughly in the middle of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle if there is one, or roughly in the middle of the door if there isn't a handle.
To push the door closed reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Push the door closed
    First, put the robot's gripper above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is almost lined up with the door handle, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
