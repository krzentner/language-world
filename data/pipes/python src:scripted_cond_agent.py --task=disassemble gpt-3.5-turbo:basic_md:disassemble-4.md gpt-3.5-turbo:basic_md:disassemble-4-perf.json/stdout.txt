To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with the peg, the robot should align the wrench to the peg.
- When the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, the robot should open the gripper around the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench off the peg.
