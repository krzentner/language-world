To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not holding the stick, the robot should place the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the thermos is not near the stick, the robot should maneuver the stick above the thermos.
- When the stick is above the thermos, the robot should hook the end of the stick under the thermos handle.
- When the end of the stick is hooked under the thermos handle, the robot should pull the stick away from the target location, which will eventually pull the thermos to the target location.
