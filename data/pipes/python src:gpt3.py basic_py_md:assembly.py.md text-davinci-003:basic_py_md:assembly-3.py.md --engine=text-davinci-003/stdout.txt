The code for the assembly task would look like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.align("wrench to peg")
    if check("the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg"):
        robot.insert("wrench around peg")
```
