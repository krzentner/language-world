    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the mug handle  2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper  3. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    If the mug handle is below the gripper, we should be able to grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug handle is around the gripper, we can just move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
