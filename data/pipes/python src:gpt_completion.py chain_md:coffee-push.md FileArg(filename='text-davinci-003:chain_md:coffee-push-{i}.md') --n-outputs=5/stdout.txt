    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Grab the mug handle  4. Push mug to goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle. We want to grasp the mug as low down on the handle as possible, so that the mug remains stable while it's being moved.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the mug handle, we should be able to grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle. 
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, grab the mug handle by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should grab mug handle. 
    Now that the mug is held in the robot's gripper, try to push the mug to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is held, the robot should push mug to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Drop gripper around mug  3. Close gripper around mug  4. Move mug to goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug, so that we don't bump into anything while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place gripper above mug.
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug.
    If the gripper is near the mug and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug.
    We closed the gripper, and the mug is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the mug to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place mug at goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Lower gripper around mug  3. Grab mug with gripper  4. Move mug to target location

    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower gripper around mug.
    Once the gripper is around the mug, close the gripper firmly to grab the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug.
    Now that we have the mug in the gripper, we can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move mug to target location.
