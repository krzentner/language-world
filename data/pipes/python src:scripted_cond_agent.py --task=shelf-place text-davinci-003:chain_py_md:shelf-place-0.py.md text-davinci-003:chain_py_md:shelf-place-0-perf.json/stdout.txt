- Steps:
    1. Put gripper above block
    2. Drop gripper around block
    3. Close gripper around block
    4. Move block to target location
    5. Place block on the shelf

- If the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the gripper above the block.
    ```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.place("gripper above block")
    ```
- Once the gripper is in position, drop the gripper around the block.
    ```
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around block")
    ```
- If the gripper is near the block and open, close the gripper around it.
    ```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the block and open"):
        robot.close("gripper around block")
    ```
- Once the block is grasped, move it to the target location.
    ```
    if check("the robot's grip is closed around the block"):
        robot.move("block to target location")
    ```
- Lastly, place the block on the shelf.
    ```
    if check("the block is at the target location"):
        robot.place("block on shelf")
    ```
