Here's a program that performs the `stick-pull` task:

```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.place("the gripper above the stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("the gripper around the stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is touching the thermos"):
        robot.pull("the thermos with the stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the thermos and the thermos is near the goal"):
        robot.slide("the thermos to the goal")
```

Assuming the `check()` function returns `True` if the given condition is met, this program will have the robot:

1. Position the gripper above the stick
2. Open the gripper and position it around the stick
3. Close the gripper around the stick
4. Use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
5. Once the thermos is close to the target location, slide it into place.

Of course, implementation details will depend on the specifics of the robot, such as how the `place()`, `drop()`, `close()`, `pull()`, and `slide()` methods are defined. But the program should serve as a general outline for the `stick-pull` task.
