    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of the door dial  2. Close gripper around the door dial  3. Turn the door dial
    First, the gripper should be put towards the top of the door dial, so that it is able to grab around the edge of the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door dial
    When the robot's gripper is near the door dial, close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door dial and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, turn the door dial until it is in the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the door dial, move the robot's gripper until the door dial is in the desired position
