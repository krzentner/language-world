    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Close the gripper to grab the wrench  3. Move the wrench downward to the peg  4. Open the gripper so the wrench can grab the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    If the gripper is lined up above the wrench, we should be able to grab the wrench by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is closed around the wrench, we can move it downward to the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above peg
    Once the wrench is above the peg, we should open the gripper so that the wrench can grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
