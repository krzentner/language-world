Then, the rest of the program:

```
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the block
    #  2. Drop gripper around the block
    #  3. Pick up the block
    #  4. Move block to destination
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the block")
    # If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the block", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
    # If the gripper is near the target location, release the block by
    # opening the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location", close_gripper=False)
```


After this, the code would look like: 

```
# shelf-place: pick up the block and place it at the target location
# def shelf_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above block
    #  2. Drop gripper around block
    #  3. Close gripper around block
    #  4. Move block to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the block, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the block")
    # If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the block", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above block
2. Drop gripper around block
3. Grip block with gripper
4. Move block above target location
5. Place block in target position

    if check("the robot's gripper is near the block and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
    # Now, move the block to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Once the block is lined up with the target location, place it on the shelf.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location", open_gripper=True)


The robot should pick up the block and place it at the target location.

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above block 
2. Drop gripper around block 
3. Close gripper around block 
4. Move block to target location

Steps:
1. Put gripper above the block
2. Drop gripper around the block
3. Close gripper around the block
4. Move block to goal

If the robot's gripper is not above the block, move it above the block.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the block")
```

If the gripper isn't around the block, move it around the block.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the block", close_gripper=True)
```

If the gripper is near the block and open, close the gripper to grab the block.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the goal")
```

If the gripper is near the target location with the block, move the gripper away from the block to release it.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("away from the block")
```
