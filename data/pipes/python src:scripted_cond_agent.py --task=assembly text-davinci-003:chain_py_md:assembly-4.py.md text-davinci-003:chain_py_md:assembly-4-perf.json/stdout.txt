Then your code should look something like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put gripper above the wrench handle
    # 2. Drop the gripper around the wrench handle
    # 3. Line up the wrench with the peg, as seen from above
    # 4. Close the gripper around the handle of the wrench
    # 5. Place the wrench around the peg

    # First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench handle")

    # Once the gripper is lined up above the wrench handle, we can drop it around
    # the handle so that we can gain control of the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around wrench handle")
    
    # When the gripper is around the wrench handle and the gripper is closed, we 
    # can line up the wrench with the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.align("wrench with peg, as seen from above")

    # Once the wrench is lined up with the peg, close the gripper so we can keep
    # control of it.
    if check("the wrench is vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle of wrench")

    # Finally, we can place the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the wrench is aligned with the peg"):
        robot.place("wrench around peg")
