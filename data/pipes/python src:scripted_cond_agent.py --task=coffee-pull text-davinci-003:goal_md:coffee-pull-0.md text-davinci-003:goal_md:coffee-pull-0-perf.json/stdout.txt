1. Put gripper first above, then around the mug handle
2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper
3. Start pulling the mug towards target
4. Keep the mug steady when moving
    
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
- When the mug is near the target, decrease the speed of the robot's movement to keep the mug steady
