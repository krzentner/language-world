Here's the program that performs the `sweep-into` task:

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Sweep around cube with gripper
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube to goal
    # First, put the gripper above cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    # Sweep the gripper around the cube. This will ensure the robot can grab it
    # no matter which direction the cube is facing.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.sweep("gripper around cube")
    # Once the gripper is around the cube, close the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # As long as the gripper is still around the cube, move the cube to the
    # target goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around cube"):
        robot.place("cube at goal")
```


Steps: 
  1. Put the gripper just above the cube
  2. Put the gripper around the cube
  3. Close the gripper around the cube
  4. Move the cube to the target location
  

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper just above the cube
    #  2. Put the gripper around the cube
    #  3. Close the gripper around the cube
    #  4. Move the cube to the target location
    # First, put the gripper just above the cube so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    # If the gripper is above the cube, then grab the cube by moving the
    # gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is not around cube"):
        robot.grab("cube")
    # If the gripper is around the cube and open, we should be able to grab it
    # by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around cube and robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the cube to the target location.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("cube at target")


The robot needs to grab the cube and move it to the target location.

Steps:

1. Put gripper above the cube
2. Reach the gripper onto the cube
3. Close the gripper around the cube
4. Sweep the cube to the target location

# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps: 
    # 1. Put gripper above the cube 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    # 2. Reach the gripper onto the cube
    # Since the cube is relatively small, it's important to line the gripper up
    # as best as possible, which may require the robot to scan the cube before
    # reaching its gripper on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube"):
        robot.reach("gripper onto cube")
    # 3. Close the gripper around the cube
    # Once the gripper is around the cube, we can close the gripper around it
    if check("the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # 4. Sweep the cube to the target location
    # After the cube is securely in the gripper, we can sweep the cube to the
    # target location
    if check("the robot has closed its gripper around the cube and the cube is not at the target location"):
        robot.sweep("cube to target location")


The code for `sweep-into` should look like this:

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper to the left of the cube
    #  2. Move the gripper in a sweeping motion to grab the cube
    #  3. Place the cube at the goal
    # Put the gripper to the left of the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the left of the cube"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of cube")
    # Move the gripper in a sweeping motion starting to the left of the cube,
    # curving in to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not sweeping across the cube and the gripper is not near the cube"):
        robot.sweep("gripper towards cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube and no longer sweeping, it's probably
    # caught the cube.
    # Close the gripper to make sure it holds the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # Move the held cube to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.sweep("cube to goal")
```


Steps:
1. Move the robot's gripper to be behind the cube.
2. Grab the cube from the back side with the gripper.
3. Move the cube to the target location. 

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the robot's gripper to be behind the cube.
    #  2. Grab the cube from the back side with the gripper.
    #  3. Move the cube to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not behind the cube"):
        robot.move("gripper behind cube")

    if check("the robot's gripper is behind the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube"):
        robot.grab("cube from back")
    
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("cube to goal")

```
