    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the faucet  2. Slowly rotate the faucet handle counterclockwise  3. Increase the pressure and rotate faster
    If the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet and not near it, move the gripper near the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet and not near it, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet
    If the gripper is near the faucet handle, start turning it slowly counterclockwise to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is opened
    If the robot's gripper is close to the faucet handle, then increase the pressure to open the faucet and rotate faster.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is opened
