    Steps: 1. Pick up the stick with the gripper  2. Put stick ahead of the thermos  3. Drag the stick towards the target location  4. Push the stick against the thermos 
    First, pick up the stick with gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the stick is not ahead of the thermos, move the stick ahead of the thermos
    - When the stick is not ahead of the thermos and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the stick is ahead of the thermos
    Now that the stick is in the right place, drag it towards the target location.
    - When the stick is ahead of thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the target location
    When the stick is lined up between the thermos and the target location, push the stick against the thermos.
    - When the stick is ahead of the thermos and the stick is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the stick is pushing the thermos towards the target location
