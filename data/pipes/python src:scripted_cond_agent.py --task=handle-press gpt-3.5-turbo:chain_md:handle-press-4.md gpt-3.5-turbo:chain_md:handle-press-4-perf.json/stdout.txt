The following steps can be taken to reliably push down the handle:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    If the gripper is near the handle and open, close the gripper to make sure we have control of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push down on the handle.
