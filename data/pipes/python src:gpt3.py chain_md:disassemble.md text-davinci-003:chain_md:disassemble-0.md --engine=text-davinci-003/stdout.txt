    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench off the peg  4. Move the wrench away from the peg
    We need to grab the wrench before we can try to take it off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.

    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the wrench is still on the peg, the robot should lift wrench off peg.
    If the wrench is off the peg, move it away from the peg.
