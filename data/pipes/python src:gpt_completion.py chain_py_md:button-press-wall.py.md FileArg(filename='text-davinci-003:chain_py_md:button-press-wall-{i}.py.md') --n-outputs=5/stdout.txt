# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the robot's gripper in front of the button and the wall
    #  2. Push against the wall to push the button
    #  3. Push harder against the wall to press the button
    # First, move the robot's gripper to the same level as the button and the
    # wall. We need the wall to be between the button and the gripper so that we
    # can press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of button and wall"):
        robot.put("gripper in front of button and wall")
    # Once the gripper is in front of the button and wall, push the wall slightly
    # forward to press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of button and wall"):
        robot.push("against wall")
    # If the button hasn't been pressed yet, push harder against the wall.
    if check("the button is not pressed"):
        robot.push("harder against wall")


Steps:
    1. Place the gripper below the short wall aligned to the button
    2. Push upwards against the short wall
    3. Push against the button from the front

if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not below the wall"):
    robot.place("gripper below wall aligned to the button")
if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button and the gripper is not pressing against the wall"):
    robot.push("upward against the wall")
if check("the robot's gripper is pressing against the wall and the robot's gripper is not pressing against the button"):
    robot.push("against the button from the front")


Steps: 
1. Put the gripper horizontally in front of the button 
2. Push the wall aside to make room for the gripper
3. Push down on the button 

```

# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper horizontally in front of the button
    #  2. Push the wall aside to make room for the gripper
    #  3. Push down on the button
    # Put the gripper horizontally in front of the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper forward of button")
    # Now move the wall aside to make room for the gripper.
    if check("the wall is in the way of gripper"):
        robot.push("wall aside")
    # Now that the gripper can reach the button, push down on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```


The program should be as follows: 

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above button
    #  2. Align gripper line up with the wall
    #  3. Push gripper through the opening in the wall to press the button
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Try to line up the gripper with the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not lined up with the wall"):
        robot.align("gripper with the wall")
    # If the gripper is lined up with the wall, then try to push it through the
    # opening in the wall to press the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is lined up with the wall"):
        robot.push("gripper through the wall opening")
```


The steps would be:

1. Move the gripper to the right of the button
2. Put the gripper snuggly against the wall
3. Push the button down

    #  3. Push the button down
    # Move the gripper to the right of the button, so that the wall will be
    # between the gripper and the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the button"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of button")
    # Now put the gripper against the wall, so that the gripper won't slip while
    # pushing the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not against wall"):
        robot.put("gripper against wall")
    # Now that the gripper is against the wall, push the button down.
