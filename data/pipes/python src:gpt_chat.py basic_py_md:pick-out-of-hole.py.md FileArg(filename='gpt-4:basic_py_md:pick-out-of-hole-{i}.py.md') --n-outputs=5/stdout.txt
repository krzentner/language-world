Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Here's the program to perform the `pick-out-of-hole` task:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.place("the gripper above the hole")
    if check("the gripper is not around the peg and the gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("the gripper around the peg")
    if check("the gripper is near the peg and the gripper is open"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the peg")
    if check("the gripper is above the peg and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the peg out of the hole")
        robot.reach("to goal")
```

This program follows the structure of the previous ones, checking for specific conditions and then calling the appropriate actions. In this case, the robot first moves its gripper above the peg, then closes it around the peg, and finally lifts the peg out of the hole and moves it to the goal location.
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the hole"):
        robot.push("gripper into hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.lift("peg out of hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move("gripper to target location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.place("peg at target location")
Here's the program to perform the `pick-out-of-hole` task:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the hole"):
        robot.move("to the hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not closed around the peg"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hole and the peg is in the gripper"):
        robot.move("to the goal")
``` 

This code instructs the robot to move to the hole, grab the peg, and move to the goal while holding onto the peg.
Sure, here's the code to perform the `pick-out-of-hole` task:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole"):
        robot.move("gripper above the hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the peg out of the hole")
        robot.reach("to goal")
``` 

This code ensures that the robot's gripper is above the hole containing the peg, and then grabs the peg using the gripper. After lifting the peg out of the hole, it moves the gripper to the target location.
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the peg is in the hole and the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above the hole")
    if check("the peg is in the hole and the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    if check("the peg is in the hole and the robot's gripper is around the peg"):
        robot.lift("peg out of hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.put("gripper above target location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.drop("gripper around target location") 

# Note: You will need to define the `check` function to provide the necessary condition checks, and also define the `robot` object that the code uses to control the robot.
