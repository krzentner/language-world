To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the block  2. Drop the gripper around the block  3. Close the gripper around the block  4. Move the block to the goal location  5. Open the gripper to release the block
    First, place the gripper above the block to prepare for grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should put the gripper above the block.
    Once the gripper is above the block, drop the gripper around the block to start grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
    Close the gripper around the block, and make sure the block is secure to hold it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
    Move the block to the goal location.
    - When the robot is holding the block, the robot should move the block to the goal location.
    Open the gripper to release the block.
    - When the block is at the goal location and the gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper to release the block.
