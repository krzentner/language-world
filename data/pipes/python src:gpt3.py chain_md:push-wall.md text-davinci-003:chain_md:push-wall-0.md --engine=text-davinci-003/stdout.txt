    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Push against the wall  4. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can push against the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push against the wall.
    Once the wall is moved, the robot can slide the puck to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the wall is not in the way, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
