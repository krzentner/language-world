Note: This code assumes that the sweeping area is located along the robot's horizontal axis, and that the robot should approach the area from the same side on which it can slide the cube towards the goal. If these assumptions are incorrect, the code may need to be adapted accordingly. Also, the comment `check()` is not defined in the given code, so you may need to either implement it or replace it with a suitable condition that reflects the robot's perception of its surroundings.
