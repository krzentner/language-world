    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck over wall to goal
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Once the gripper is above the puck, try to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    Once the gripper is around the puck and closed, move the puck around the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck over wall to goal.
