# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push gripper into top of plate
    #  3. Slide plate to goal
    # The robot can slide the plate by trapping it by pushing down on it from
    # above and moving the gripper.
    # If the plate isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the plate.

    # down to the plate to slide it.
