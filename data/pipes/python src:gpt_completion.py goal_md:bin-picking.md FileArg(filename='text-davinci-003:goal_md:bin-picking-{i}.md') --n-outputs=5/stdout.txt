    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Move cube to the target bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above the cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin

    Steps:  1. Reach for the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Reach for the target bin  4. Place the cube in the target bin.
    The first step is to reach for the cube. We can do this by moving the robot's gripper directly to the cube, if the target is visible. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube
    Once the robot's gripper is near the cube, the robot can grab the cube by closing the gripper
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Once the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, we can start to move toward the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin
    Once the robot's gripper is near the target bin, the robot can place the cube inside by opening the gripper and then releasing it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the bin

    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper noted from the top. 2. Place the gripper under the cube. 3. Place the cube into the bin.
    First, line up the robot's gripper as viewed from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can lower the gripper down to the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with cube and the robot's gripper is not below cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the cube
    After the gripper is below the cube, open the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is below cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    With the cube in the gripper, move the gripper above the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin

    Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Pick up the cube with the gripper  3. Reorient the cube for the target bin  4. Place the cube in the target bin
    First, reach towards the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is holding the cube
    Then reorient the cube for the target bin, if necessary
    - When the cube is held by the robot's gripper and the cube is not reoriented for the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the cube is reoriented for the target bin
    Place the cube in the target bin.
    - When the cube is held by the robot's gripper and the cube is reoriented for the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the cube is near the target bin

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Reach down and grab the cube  3. Move the cube to the bin  4. Drop the cube into the bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the bin.
    If the bin is aligned with the gripper, drop the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the bin and the bin is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin.
