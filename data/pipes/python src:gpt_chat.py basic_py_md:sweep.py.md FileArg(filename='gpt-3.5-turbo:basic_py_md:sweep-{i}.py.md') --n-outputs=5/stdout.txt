Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Here's the program to perform the `sweep` task:

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    if check("the gripper is not open"):
        robot.open("the gripper")
    if check("the gripper is not near the cube"):
        robot.reach("the cube")
    if check("the gripper is not around the cube"):
        robot.grab("the cube")
    if check("the gripper is not above the goal location"):
        robot.move("to the goal location sideways")
    if check("the gripper is above the goal location"):
        robot.slide("cube to the goal location")
    if check("the gripper is not open yet"):
        robot.open("the gripper")
```

This program first checks if the gripper is open, and if it's not, it opens it. Then it checks if the gripper is near the cube, and if it's not, it reaches for the cube. Once the gripper is close enough to the cube, it checks if the gripper is around the cube, and if it's not, it grabs the cube. Then it checks if the gripper is above the goal location, and if it's not, it moves sideways to get there. Once the gripper is in position above the goal location, it slides the cube to the goal location. Finally, it checks if the gripper is still closed, and if it is, it opens it so that the cube is released.
# sweep: grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the cube off the table")
    if check("the robot is not sideways aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move("to the side of the target location")
    if check("the robot is sideways aligned with the target location"):
        robot.push("the cube to the target location")
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
    robot.place("the gripper above cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("the gripper around cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.close("the gripper around cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is holding cube and the robot is not near target"):
    robot.move("to the side")
if check("the robot is at the target location"):
    robot.drop("cube")
```
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        if check("the robot is not close to the sweeping area"):
            robot.move("to the sweeping area")
        if check("the robot is on the left side of the sweeping area"):
            robot.slide("cube to the right")
        if check("the robot is on the right side of the sweeping area"):
            robot.slide("cube to the left")
        if check("the robot is back to the initial position"):
            robot.place("cube at goal")
``` 

Note: This code assumes that the sweeping area is located along the robot's horizontal axis, and that the robot should approach the area from the same side on which it can slide the cube towards the goal. If these assumptions are incorrect, the code may need to be adapted accordingly. Also, the comment `check()` is not defined in the given code, so you may need to either implement it or replace it with a suitable condition that reflects the robot's perception of its surroundings.
Here's the program for the `sweep` task:

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        if check("the gripper is not positioned correctly to sweep the cube"):
            robot.move("gripper to side of cube")
        robot.slide("the cube to the goal")
``` 

This code assumes that there is a `check` function that returns `True` if the condition passed as argument is satisfied, and `False` otherwise. The `robot` object has several methods that allow it to manipulate the gripper and perform specific actions. The `sweep` function first uses the `place` and `drop` methods to correctly position the gripper around the cube. Once the gripper is closed around the cube, it uses the `move` method to position the gripper correctly to sweep the cube sideways, before finally using the `slide` method to move the cube to the goal location.
