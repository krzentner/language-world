    Steps:  1. Put gripper forward of the plate 2. Push the plate left to slide it back 3. Push the plate back further
    We should start by putting the gripper forward of the plate so that we have maneuvering space. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with plate, the robot should put gripper in front of plate.
    To start sliding the plate back, we should push the plate left. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the plate is not to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push plate left.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, we can push it further left to move it back into the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the plate is to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push plate back further.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Line up the gripper with the plate from above  3. Slide the plate back sideways
    Because the plate needs to be slid back into the target location, it's best to approach the plate from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    As long the gripper is lined up with the plate from the top, move the gripper towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, the robot should move gripper towards the target location.
    If the plate is close enough, slide the plate back sideways into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should slide plate back sideways.

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper forward of plate 2. Push the plate back to target location
    Firstly, the robot needs to put the gripper forward of plate.
    -When the robot's gripper is not forward of plate, the robot should move the gripper forward of plate.
    As long as the plate is left of the robot's gripper, start pushing the plate back to the target.
    -When the robot's gripper is forward of plate and the plate is left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push the plate back to target location.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper next to plate  2. Slide plate away from gripper  3. Move plate backwards to goal
    If the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move it to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should put the gripper next to plate.
    If the plate is near the gripper, we can slide it away from the gripper using the same method as pulling a door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not away from the robot's gripper, the robot should slide plate away from gripper.
    Now that the plate is away from the gripper, move it back toward the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is away from the robot's gripper, the robot should move plate back to goal.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the plate  2. Move the gripper back and sideways to push the plate  3. Push the plate as it moves back
    First, put the gripper to the side of the plate.
    - When the gripper is not at the side of the plate, the robot should move gripper to side of plate.
    Once the gripper is to the side of the plate, we should move the gripper back and sideways to push the plate.
    - When the gripper is side aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not behind plate, the robot should push plate back sideways.
    Once the robot is pushing the plate, continue pushing it until it is back in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind plate and the plate is not in target location, the robot should push plate back until in target location.
