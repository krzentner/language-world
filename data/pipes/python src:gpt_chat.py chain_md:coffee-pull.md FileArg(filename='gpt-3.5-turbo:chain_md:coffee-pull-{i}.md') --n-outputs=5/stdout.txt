To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Pull mug towards goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not lined up with the mug handle vertically, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    If the gripper is above the mug handle, try to grab it by moving the gripper down around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, the robot should drop gripper around the mug handle.
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can try to pull the mug towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, the robot should pull mug towards goal.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper about an inch above mug's handle
2. Drop gripper around mug's handle
3. Lift the mug straight up
4. Move the gripper to the target location
5. Put the mug down on the target location

First, place the gripper above the mug's handle but far enough so as not to knock it over.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug's handle.
Next, drop the gripper around the mug's handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug's handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug's handle.
Lift the mug straight up so that it is securely held by the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug's handle, the robot should lift the mug straight up.
Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
Finally, put the mug down at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should put the mug down on the target location carefully.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Lift the mug up  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Lower the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, lift the mug up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not holding the mug, the robot should grab handle and lift mug up.
    Move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and is not near the target location, the robot should move the mug to the target location.
    Finally, lower the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and is holding the mug, the robot should lower the mug to the target location.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Pull the mug towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    If the gripper is not around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle.
    If the gripper is near the mug handle and open, grab the mug by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug handle.
    We closed the gripper, and the mug is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to pull the mug towards the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull mug towards the target location.
To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps: 

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around mug handle  2. Lift mug and move it towards goal  3. Place mug at goal
    First, put the gripper around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, the robot should put gripper around the mug handle.
    Once the mug is in the gripper, lift it up and move it towards the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug, the robot should lift the mug and move it towards the goal.
    Finally, place the mug at the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the goal location, the robot should place the mug at the goal location.
