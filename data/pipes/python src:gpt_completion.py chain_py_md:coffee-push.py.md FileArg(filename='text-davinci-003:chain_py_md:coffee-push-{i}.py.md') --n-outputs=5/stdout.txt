We need to grab the mug and move it to the target location. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Put the gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around mug handle
3. Close gripper around mug handle
4. Move the mug to the goal

If the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, we need to move it above the mug handle:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug handle")
```

Once the gripper is above the mug handle, we need to drop it around the mug handle:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around mug handle")
```

If the gripper is near the mug handle and open, we can grab it by closing the gripper:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near mug handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around mug handle")
```

Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can move the mug to the goal:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug handle"):
        robot.place("mug at goal")
```


The steps are:
1. Line up the robot's gripper as viewed from above the mug 
2. Close the gripper around the mug
3. Move the mug to the target location 

Solution: 
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the robot's gripper as viewed from above the mug
    #  2. Close the gripper around the mug
    #  3. Move the mug to the target location
    # Line up the robot's gripper with the mug as seen from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug")
    # Once the gripper is around the mug, close the gripper to trap the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around mug")
    # Now that the mug is trapped, move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is in gripper"):
        robot.move("mug to target")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above mug
  2. Drop gripper around mug
  3. Pick up mug
  4. Pull mug away from starting location
  5. Slide mug towards target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
    robot.put("gripper above mug")
if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around mug")
if check("the robot's gripper is near mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.pick("up mug")
if check("the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.pull("mug away from start")
if check("the robot's gripper is near mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.slide("mug towards the goal")


Solution:

```
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above mug handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around mug handle
    #  3. Close gripper around mug handle
    #  4. Move mug to goal
    # First, get the robot's gripper into a position where it can grab the mug
    # handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug handle")
    # Now that the gripper is above the mug handle, move the gripper to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around mug handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the mug handle, close the gripper to grab the
    # mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around mug handle")
    # Now that the mug is securely in the robot's gripper, move the mug to the
    # goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("mug to goal")
```


The steps to complete this task are as follows:

1. Put the gripper above the mug.
2. Grab the mug with the gripper.
3. Move the mug to the target location.

Therefore, the program will look like this:

```
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above mug
    #  2. Grab mug with gripper
    #  3. Move mug to target location
    # Put the gripper above the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
        robot.put("gripper above mug")
    # Grab the mug with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("mug")
    # Move the mug to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("mug to target location")
``
