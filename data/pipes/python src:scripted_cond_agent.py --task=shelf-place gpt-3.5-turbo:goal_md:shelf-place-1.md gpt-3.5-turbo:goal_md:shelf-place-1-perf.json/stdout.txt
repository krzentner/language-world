The task `shelf-place` requires the robot to pick up the block and place it at the target location. To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the block
2. Lower the gripper around the block
3. Close the gripper around the block
4. Lift up the block
5. Move the gripper to the target location
6. Lower the gripper to place the block at the target location

First, put the gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
Next, lower the gripper around the block and close the gripper to hold the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the gripper is closed
Lift up the block by moving the gripper up.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the floor
Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the floor and not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
Lower the block to place it at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is open
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the block is placed at the target location.
