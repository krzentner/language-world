    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Grab the handle  3. Rise the gripper to lift the handle
    First, the robot should put its gripper above the handle and then drop it around the handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is closed 
    When the robot's gripper is in front of the handle, grab it by closing the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle.
    After the robot's gripper is above the handle, the robot can just rise the gripper to lift the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
