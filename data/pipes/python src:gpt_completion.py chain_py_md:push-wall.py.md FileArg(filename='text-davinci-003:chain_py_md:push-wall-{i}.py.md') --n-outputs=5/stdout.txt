Steps:

1. Put gripper left of the puck with enough space for the small wall
2. Put the gripper against the wall
3. Push the gripper against the wall to slide the puck to the target location

# def push_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the puck with enough space for the small wall
    #  2. Put the gripper against the wall
    #  3. Push the gripper against the wall to slide the puck to the target location
    # First, put the gripper left of the puck with enough space for the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of puck and the robot's gripper is not far enough away to leave space for wall"):
        robot.put("gripper left of puck with enough space for wall")
    # Make sure the gripper is against the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not against wall"):
        robot.put("gripper against wall")
    # Now, push against the wall with the gripper to slide the puck to the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is against wall"):
        robot.push("against wall to slide puck to goal")


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the puck
2. Push gently against the wall, so that the puck can move
3. Push the puck to the goal

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.place("gripper above puck")

Next, we'll gently push against the wall so the puck can slide to the goal.
if check("the robot's gripper is not gently pushing against wall"):
    robot.push("gently against wall")

Finally, push the puck to the goal. This should be easy since we already moved the wall out of the way.
if check("puck is not near goal"):
    robot.slide("puck to goal")


Steps:
1. Place the gripper right of the wall
2. Lower the gripper over the top of the puck
3. Push the puck with the wall

    #  1. Place the gripper right of the wall
    #  2. Lower the gripper over the top of the puck

    # We need to put the robot's gripper near the wall before beginning the
    # task.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to the right of the wall"):
        robot.place("gripper to the right of the wall")
    # Once the robot's gripper is near the wall, lower it to the top of the
    # puck.
    # We don't have to be careful about the angle, since the wall limits the
    # movement available.
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the right of the wall and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.drop("gripper over puck")
    # Now that the gripper is above the puck and the wall is between the gripper
    # and the puck we can start pushing with the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the wall is between the gripper and the puck"):
        robot.push("puck with wall")


Steps:
1. Put gripper near or above the puck
2. Push gripper into the puck while avoiding the wall
3. Push puck to the goal

If the robot's gripper is not near or above the puck, move the gripper to the puck.
if check("the robot's gripper is not near or above puck"):
    robot.put("gripper near or above puck")

If the robot's gripper is near the puck, move the gripper so it is pushing the puck away from the wall.
if check("the robot's gripper is near puck"):
    robot.push("the gripper into the puck while avoiding the wall")

Once the puck is pushed away from the wall, move it to the goal.
if check("the puck is pushed away from the wall"):
    robot.move("the puck to the goal")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above wall
  2. Push gripper against the wall in desired shovelling direction
  3. Push puck until it is past the wall

First, put the gripper up above the wall and line it up with the shoving direction.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the shoving direction"):
    robot.put("gripper above wall")

Once lined up, push the beat by pushing the gripper against the wall.
if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the shoving direction and the robot's gripper is not pushing against the wall"):
    robot.push("gripper against wall")

Once the beat is pushed past the wall, continue pushing it towards the goal.
if check("the puck is past the wall and the robot's gripper is pushing against the wall"):
    robot.push("puck towards goal")
