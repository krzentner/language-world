Step 1: Line Up Gripper From the Side

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper from the side
    #  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.align("gripper to handle from side")
```

Step 2: Push Down the Handle

```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper from the side
    #  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.align("gripper to handle from side")
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.push("down on the handle")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper beside the handle
2. Push down on the handle

if check("the robot's gripper is not sideways aligned with handle"):
    robot.put("gripper beside handle")

if check("the robot's gripper is sideways aligned with the handle"):
    robot.push("down on handle")


Steps:
1. Put gripper above the handle.
2. Drop gripper around the handle.
3. Push down the handle.

Solution:
```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around the handle
    #  3. Push down the handle
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```


Steps
1. Put gripper right of the handle
2. Put gripper above the handle
3. Push down on the handle from the side

if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the handle"):
    robot.put("gripper right of handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
    robot.put("gripper above handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle"):
    robot.push("down on handle from side")


Steps:
 1. Put gripper left of the handle
 2. Push down on the handle
 
 
```
# handle-press-side: push down the handle from the side
# def handle_press_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the handle
    #  2. Push down on the handle
    # First, align the gripper to the left of the handle from the side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper left of handle")
    # Once the robot's gripper is left of the handle, press it down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is left of the handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```
