To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, the robot should put the gripper above the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is not holding the hammer, the robot should grab the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, the robot should move the gripper and hammer above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper and hammer are above the nail, the robot should lower the hammer onto the nail.
- When the hammer hits the nail, the robot should lift the hammer and repeat the lowering action until the nail has been fully driven in.
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the nail, the robot should position itself above the nail.
- When the hammer is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should pick up the hammer.
- When the hammer is in the robot's gripper, the robot should position the hammer above the nail.
