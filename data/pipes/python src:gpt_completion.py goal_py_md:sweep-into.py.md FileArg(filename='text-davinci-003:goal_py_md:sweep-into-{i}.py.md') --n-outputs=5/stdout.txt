The program would look something like this:

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube to target location
    # Put the gripper above the cube. We don't have to worry about being too
    # precise here, since we're just trying to grab the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, move it around the cube to pick it
    # up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the cube", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the cube and open, close the gripper to hold the
    # cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("towards the target location")
    # If the gripper is holding the cube, move it towards the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above cube
  2. Drop gripper around cube
  3. Close gripper around cube
  4. Sweep cube to target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the gripper above the cube.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
```

If the robot's gripper is not around the cube, put it around the cube.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the cube", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is near the cube and closed, move the gripper down to sweep the cube towards the target location.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Drop gripper around cube
    #  3. Close gripper around cube
    #  4. Move cube to the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the cube", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Once the gripper is around the cube and holding it, we can just move the
    # gripper to the target location to move the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the cube
  2. Sweep the cube in a plateau with the gripper
  3. Push the cube to the target location

# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the cube
    #  2. Sweep the cube in a plateau with the gripper
    #  3. Push the cube to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the cube so that it can sweep it without
    # bumping it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
    # Once the gripper is above the cube, sweep it inwards in a plateau.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the cube")
    # As long as the the cube isn't at the target location, keep pushing the
    # cube in a plateau.
    if check("the cube is not at the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("towards the target location")
    # If the gripper is close to the target, just move the gripper to the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is nearly at the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("right at the target location")


Then, complete the program:

```
# sweep-into: grab the cube and move it to the target location
# def sweep_into(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper in an arc, from above the cube to the target location
    #  2. Close the gripper around the cube
    #  3. Move to the target location with the cube in the gripper
    # First, move the gripper in a sweeping arc, starting above the cube and
    # ending above the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not in an arc, from above the cube to the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("in an arc, from above the cube to the target location")
    # Once the gripper is above the cube, close it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is closed around the cube, we can move to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```
