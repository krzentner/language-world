To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the gripper is not around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should slide the mug to the location while keeping it lifted. 
- When the mug is over the target location, the robot should lower the mug and release the gripper.
