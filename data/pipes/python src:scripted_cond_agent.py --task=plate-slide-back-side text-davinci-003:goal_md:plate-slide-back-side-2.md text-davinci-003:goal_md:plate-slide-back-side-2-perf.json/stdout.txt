    Steps:  1. Put the gripper at one side of the plate  2. Push sideways to the begin the slide  3. Push further towards the target location
    First, put the gripper at one side of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at one side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at one side of the plate
    If the robot's gripper is lined up with the plate, we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is at one side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate 
    If the robot's gripper is aligned with the plate, we can start pushing the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
