To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole.
To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line up the peg with the hole
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole

More specifically, the following actions should be taken:

1. First, put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Next, grab the peg with the gripper.
- If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. Once the gripper is around the peg, line up the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.
- When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg.

4. Finally, insert the peg into the hole by sliding it sideways.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole.
To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. Line the peg up with the hole.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole.
- When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg.
To insert the peg into the hole from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. Line up the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole.

4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole.
- While holding the peg above the hole, move the robot's gripper sideways until the peg slides into the hole.
To insert the peg into the hole reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line the peg up with the hole
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole

Here are the more detailed explanations for each step:
1. First, put the gripper above the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Once the gripper is above the peg, grab the peg with the gripper.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. As long as the gripper is mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
   - When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and not forward-aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.
   - When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg.

4. Once the gripper is above the peg positioned over the hole, slide the peg sideways into the hole.
   - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole.
