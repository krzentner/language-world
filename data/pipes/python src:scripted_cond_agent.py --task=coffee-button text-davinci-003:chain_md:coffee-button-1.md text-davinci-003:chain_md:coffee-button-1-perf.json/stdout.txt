    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the button  2. Align the gripper in front of the button  3. Push the button down 
    The robot needs to line its gripper up with the button from above, since it will be coming down on it from above. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    To keep the gripper from pushing off the button when it's not fully lined up, make sure it's lined up from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, the robot should align gripper in front of button. 
    Once the gripper is lined up and in front of the button, just push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button, the robot should push button down.
