    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the button  2. Push the button with the gripper.
    First we should make sure that the gripper is near the button, so we don't bump it while trying to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the button, the robot should move gripper to button.
    If the gripper is near the button, we should be able to push it by the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button, the robot should push down button with gripper.
