    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Push the plate to the goal  3. Slide the plate to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    We can push the plate to the goal by pushing down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should push the plate to the goal.
    If the gripper is near the plate and the plate is still not at the goal, we need to slide the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not at the goal, the robot should slide plate to goal.
