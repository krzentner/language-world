    Steps:  1. Put the gripper of the robot above the hammer  2. Drop the gripper around the hammer  3. Line up the hammer with the nail  4. Swing the hammer towards the nail
    First, put the gripper of the robot above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hammer
    If the gripper is not around the hammer, put it around the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the hammer and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is lined up with the nail
    Once the hammer is lined up with the nail, swing the hammer towards the nail.
    - When the hammer is lined up with the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is in contact with the nail
