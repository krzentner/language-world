# Steps:
    #  1. Turn gripper sideways to fit through gap in wall
    #  2. Move gripper towards button
    #  3. Line up gripper with button
    #  4. Push the button

    # tilt and press the button.

    #  2. Move the gripper in front of the button

    #  1. Line up the gripper with the button from the front
    #  2. Push the gripper forward, bumping gently against the wall
    #  3. Push down on the button
    # Because there is a wall in the way, we need to bump against it gently and
    # then push down on the button. We start by lining up the gripper with the
    # button as seen from the front.
