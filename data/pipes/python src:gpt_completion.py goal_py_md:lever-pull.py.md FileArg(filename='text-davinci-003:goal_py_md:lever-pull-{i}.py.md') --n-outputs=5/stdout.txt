Steps:
  1. Put gripper above lever
  2. Drop gripper around lever
  3. Rotate lever up

If the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever, move the gripper near the lever.

if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the lever", close_gripper=True)

Once the gripper is in place, rotate the lever up.

if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the lever")


Steps:
1. Put gripper below the lever.
2. Rotate the gripper around and grab the lever.
3. Move the lever up.

# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper below the lever
    #  2. Rotate the gripper around and grab the lever
    #  3. Move the lever up
    # First, put the gripper below the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the lever")
    # Since we can't rotate the robot's gripper from above, if the gripper is 
    # not angled to fit around the lever, move the gripper above the lever,
    # rotate the gripper, and then lower it back to the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lever")
        robot.move_gripper("rotate the gripper")
        robot.move_gripper("below the lever")
    # Once the gripper is around the lever, close the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the lever", close_gripper=True)
    # With the gripper closed, rotate the lever up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the lever")


The first step is to put the gripper below the lever. We can do this by moving the gripper to a point the same height below the lever.

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper below the lever
    #  2. Pull up the lever
    # First, put the gripper below the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the lever", close_gripper=True)
```

Next we can pull up the lever by closing the gripper and applying an upwards force.

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper below the lever
    #  2. Pull up the lever
    # First, put the gripper below the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("below the lever", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is below the lever and closed, apply an upwards force to pull up the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is below the lever and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("upwards")

```


Next, we want to go about performing the task. The robot has to pull the lever up, so we need to make sure the gripper is in a good position.
First, we need to put the gripper above the lever.

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lever 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the lever")
```

Next, we want to make sure the gripper is actually around the lever before we begin pulling.

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lever 
    #  2. Drop gripper around lever
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the lever")
```

Finally, we want to pull the lever. We can do this by moving the robot's gripper to the left of the lever.

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above lever 
    #  2. Drop gripper around lever
    #  3. Pull the lever up
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the lever"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the lever")
```

And that's it! Now the robot should be able to pull the lever up.


Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the lever
2. Drop the gripper around the lever
3. Close the gripper to hold the lever
4. Rotate the lever up

If the robot's gripper is not above the lever, move it above the lever.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not Above the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("Above the lever")
```

If the robot's gripper is above the lever, but isn't near it, move it near the lever.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not near the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the lever", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is near the lever, close the gripper around the lever.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the lever", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is around the lever, rotate the lever up towards the desired position.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the lever")
```
