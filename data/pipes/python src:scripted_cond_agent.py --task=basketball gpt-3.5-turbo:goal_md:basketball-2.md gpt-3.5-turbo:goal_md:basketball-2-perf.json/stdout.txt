To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the ball  2. Open the gripper and lower it around the ball  3. Close the gripper around the ball  4. Reach towards the hoop  5. Lift the ball while guiding it towards the hoop  6. Release the ball once it's above the hoop
First, put the gripper above the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the basketball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the basketball
If the gripper is above the basketball but isn't around it, open the gripper and lower it around the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the basketball and the robot's gripper is not around the basketball, open the gripper and lower it around the basketball
Once the gripper is closed around the basketball, reach towards the hoop.
   - Move the robot's gripper towards the hoop
To guide the ball towards the hoop while lifting it, keep moving the gripper towards the hoop while lifting the ball.
   - Move the robot's gripper towards the hoop while gradually lifting the ball
Once the ball is above the hoop, release the gripper to drop the ball into the hoop.
   - When the basketball is above the hoop, release the gripper to drop the basketball into the hoop.
