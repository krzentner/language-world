The robot should perform the following steps to push the drawer close:
1. Put the gripper roughly around the drawer handle.
2. Move the gripper to the drawer handle if it's not already close.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
3. Push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
4. Check if the drawer is fully closed, if not, repeat step 3 until it's fully closed.
