To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should move the gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, the robot should move the lid above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper and release the lid onto the box.
To perform the task `box-close`, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should move the lid towards the box.
- When the robot's gripper is near the box, the robot should release the grip and place the lid on top of the box. 
- When the lid is successfully placed on the box, the robot should move its gripper away from the box. 

It's important for the robot to ensure that the box lid is picked up and placed on the box properly without dropping it, and that it is able to move away from the box without knocking it over.
To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the box lid is not completely open, the robot should use the gripper to completely open the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is open and near the box lid, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should move the gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is not aligned with the box, the robot should align the box lid with the box.
- When the box lid is aligned with the box, the robot should lower the gripper so that the box lid rests on the box.
To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should move the gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the lid.
- When the lid is firmly gripped, the robot should lift the lid off the box.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box, the robot should move the gripper above the opening of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box opening and the gripper is open, the robot should place the lid onto the box.
- When the lid is properly positioned on the box, the robot should release its grip and open the gripper.
To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should move gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the lid, the robot should grab the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the lid, the robot should move gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box, the robot should release the lid onto the box.
