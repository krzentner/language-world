The steps the robot should perform to push the soccer ball into the target location are:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Push soccer ball to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, the robot should place gripper above soccer ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around soccer ball.
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the ball is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push the soccer ball towards the goal. 
    If we didn't trap the soccer ball, go back to an earlier step.
The steps for reliably pushing the soccer ball into the target location are as follows:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near to ball  2. Push ball into the target location
    First, the robot needs to move the gripper near to the soccer ball. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near to the ball, the robot should move the gripper near to the ball.
    If the gripper is aligned with the ball but not near it, move the gripper to the ball to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is nearby the ball, the robot should push the ball into the target location.
To push the soccer ball into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Push the soccer ball towards the target
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
    Once the gripper is above the soccer ball, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball, the robot should grab the soccer ball.
    If the soccer ball is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push it towards the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should push the soccer ball towards the target.
The steps the robot should perform to push the soccer ball into the target location are:

1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball.
2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper.
3. Move the gripper to the target location.
4. Push the soccer ball towards the target location.
5. If the soccer ball gets stuck or deviates from its course towards the target, adjust the gripper's position and try again.
6. When the soccer ball reaches the target location, release the gripper to drop the ball in the target.
To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper  3. Push the ball towards the target location
First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
If the soccer ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should grab the soccer ball with the gripper.
- When the soccer ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should grab soccer ball with the gripper.
Once the soccer ball is grabbed, move the gripper to push the ball towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball, the robot should push the ball towards the target location.
