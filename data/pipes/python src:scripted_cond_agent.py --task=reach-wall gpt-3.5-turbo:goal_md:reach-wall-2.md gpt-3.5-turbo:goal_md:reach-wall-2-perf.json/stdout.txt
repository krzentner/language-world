To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper above the wall  2. Move gripper to the target location
    First, move the robot's gripper above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the top of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the top of the wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, move it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
