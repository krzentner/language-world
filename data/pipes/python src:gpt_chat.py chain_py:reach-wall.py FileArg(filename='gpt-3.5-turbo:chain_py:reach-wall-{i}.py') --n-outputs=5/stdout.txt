# Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper to just above the wall
    #  2. Move gripper over the wall to the target
    # To reach the target with a wall in the way, we need to move the gripper
    # above the wall and then over it.
    # First, move the gripper above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper above wall")
    # Once the gripper is above the wall, move it over the wall to the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and not at the target location"):
        robot.slide("gripper over wall to reach target")
# Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper over the wall
    #  2. Reach towards the target
    # To reach over the wall, we need to move the robot's arm over the wall before
    # reaching towards the target.
    if check("the robot's arm is not over the wall"):
        robot.move("arm over the wall")
    # Now that the robot's arm is over the wall, we can just reach towards the
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's arm is over the wall"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
# Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper to right of the wall
    #  2. Move gripper up above the wall
    #  3. Move gripper left to target location
    # To reach a target location with a short wall in the way, we can first move
    # the gripper to the right of the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of wall")
    # Once the gripper is right of the wall, we can move it up above the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper up above the wall")
    # Finally, move the gripper left to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not at the target location"):
        robot.move("gripper to target location")
# Steps:
    #  1. Check if there is a wall blocking the robot's path to the target
    #  2. If there is a wall, move the gripper above the wall
    #  3. Reach to the target location
    # Check if there is a wall blocking the robot's path to the target
    if check("there is a wall blocking the robot's path to the target"):
        # Move the gripper above the wall
        robot.move("gripper above the wall")
    # Reach to the target location
    robot.reach("to goal")
# Steps:
    #  1. Check if the wall is blocking our way to the target
    #  2. If the wall is not blocking us, reach to the target
    #  3. If the wall is blocking us, move to the side to get around it,
    #     then reach to the target
    # Check if the wall is blocking our way to the target.
    if check("there is a wall blocking the path to the target"):
        # Move the robot to the side to get around the wall.
        robot.move("to the side of the wall")
    # Once we're past the wall, we can just reach to the target normally.
    robot.reach("to goal")
