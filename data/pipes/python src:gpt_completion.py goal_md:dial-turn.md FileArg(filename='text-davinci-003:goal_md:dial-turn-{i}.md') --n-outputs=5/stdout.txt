    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial 
    For turning the dial, we need to move the robot's gripper close to the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    If the gripper is still open, we should be able to grab the dial by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the desired position

    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Line up the robot's gripper with the dial  3. Grip the dial and rotate
    Before the robot can turn the dial, we need to move the gripper near the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is near the dial, we'll need to line up the gripper with the dial before we can grip and turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot's gripper is aligned with the dial, grip it and turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial

    Steps:  1. Put gripper on top of dial  2. Turn dial until it reaches the target angle  3. Release the dial
    First, put the gripper on top of the dial so that we can control the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is near the dial and closed, we can start turning the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the dial is at the target angle
    If the dial has reached the target angle, just release the dial to finish.
    - When the dial is at the target angle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is not near the dial

    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial in the direction you want 
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
    If the dial isn't left of the gripper as seen from the front, move the gripper until the dial is left of the gripper and close the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is left of the dial, close it and turn the dial in the direction you want.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial


Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the dial
2. Put gripper around the dial
3. Rotate the dial
- When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial 
- When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial 
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the dial has been rotated to the desired direction
