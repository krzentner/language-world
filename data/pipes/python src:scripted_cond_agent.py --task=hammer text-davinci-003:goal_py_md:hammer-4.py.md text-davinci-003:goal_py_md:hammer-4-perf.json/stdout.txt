The following steps should be included:

1. Put the gripper above the hammer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the hammer handle.
3. Apply force to the hammer handle by pushing the gripper against the nail. 
4. Close the gripper, ensuring a secure grip on the hammer handle. 
5. Pull the gripper away, guiding the hammer towards the nail head. 
6. Strike the nail by driving the hammer towards it with a firm grip.
