# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial in the correct direction
    #  4. Pull open the door
    # First, put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the dial")
    # If the dial isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the
    # gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the dial, turn it in the correct direction.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("in the correct direction")
    # Once the dial is turned, the door should open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the door is unlocked"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the door handle")
```


Steps: 
1. Put gripper in front of the dial
2. Slowly rotate the dial in one direction
3. Switch direction and slowly rotate in the opposite direction
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the door unlocks

if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with dial"):
  robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with dial")

initial_direction = "clockwise"
while(not check("the door is unlocked")):
  robot.rotate_gripper(initial_direction)
  initial_direction = "counter-clockwise" if initial_direction == "clockwise" else "clockwise"


## Solution

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around dial
    #  3. Rotate the dial
    # First, put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # As long as the gripper is aligned with the dial, moving the gripper
    # slightly to the right of it should allow us to grab the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the dial")
    # Once we have a grip on the dial, rotate it to the desired point.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around dial"):
        robot.rotate_gripper("to the desired point")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper directly above the dial
  2. Drop gripper to the left of the dial
  3. Turn the dial clockwise
  4. Stop turning dial when it stops of its own accord
