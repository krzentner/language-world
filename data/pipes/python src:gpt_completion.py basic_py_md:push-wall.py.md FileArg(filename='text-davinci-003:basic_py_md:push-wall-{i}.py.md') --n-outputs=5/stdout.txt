Answer: 
```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the wall and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck and wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the wall and the robot's gripper is not near puck and wall"):
        robot.push("gripper into puck and wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and wall and the puck and wall are below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("puck and wall to the goal")
```


The code should look like this:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below robot's gripper and a wall is in the way"):
        robot.slide("the puck along the wall to the goal")
```


Solution:

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("gripper into the puck and then against the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is pushing the puck against the wall"):
        robot.push("the puck and the wall until the puck is on the other side of the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall and the puck is above the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```


Then add the code:

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot and there is a wall on the right of the puck"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the left of the wall")
    if check("the wall is now on the left of the puck"):
        robot.push("the puck to the goal")
```


Solution: 
```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck around the wall to the goal")
