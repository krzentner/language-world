Steps:
1. Put gripper above mug handle
2. Drop gripper around mug handle
3. Slide mug to the target location

    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the mug handle", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the mug handle, we should be able to
    # grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the mug handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the mug handle, we can just move the mug
    # to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")


Then, fill it in with code that runs the task as outlined below:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above mug
2. Push gripper into top of mug
3. Slide mug to goal

Code:
```
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above mug
    #  2. Push gripper into top of mug
    #  3. Slide mug to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the mug, so that we don't bump it
    # while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the mug")
    # If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the mug", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the mug and open, maybe we can grab it by
    # closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```


Steps:
  1. Put gripper above mug
  2. Grab mug with the gripper
  3. Move mug to the target location

# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above mug
    #  2. Grab mug with the gripper
    #  3. Move mug to the target location
    # First, move the gripper above the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("above mug")
    # If the gripper is above the mug, but not around it, put the gripper
    # around the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is one above mug and the robot's gripper is not around mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("around mug", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is around the mug, we can start to move it to the target
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")


Then add the code to perform the following steps: 

1. Put gripper above mug.
2. Grab mug with gripper
3. Move mug to target location.

```
# coffee-push: grab the mug and move it to the target location
# def coffee_push(robot):

    #  1. Put gripper above mug
    #  2. Grab mug with gripper
    #  3. Move mug to target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above mug. We don't want to bump it while
    # grabbing it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the mug"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the mug")
    # If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the mug", close_gripper=True)
    # Then, move the mug to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the mug and the mug is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```

    if check("the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed"):

    # If the mug isn't lined up as seen from in front of the target, move the

    if check("the mug is not forward aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the target location")
