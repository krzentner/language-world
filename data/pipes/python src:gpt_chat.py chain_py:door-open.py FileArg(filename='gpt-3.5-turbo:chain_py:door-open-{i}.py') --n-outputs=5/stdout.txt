Using model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Sorry, it seems like we already have a function for door-open. Do you need me to modify it, or would you like me to create a new function for a different door?
This function is already defined above. Please see `# door-open: pull the door open` in the code block.
Oops, it looks like the function for opening the door was already defined earlier. Do you want me to write a new function or modify the existing one?
This function was already defined above. Please let me know if you need any help with implementing it.
This function was already defined above.
