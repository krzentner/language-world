    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck 2. Drop gripper around puck 3. Close gripper around puck 4. Move puck over the wall
    First, line the gripper up with the puck from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper is below the wall, raise the gripper and try again. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is forward aligned with the wall, move the gripper until the gripper is around the puck
    Now that the gripper is around the puck, close the gripper and move the puck sideways over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed and the puck is below the wall, move the robot's gripper until the puck is above the wall and the robot's gripper is above the target location
