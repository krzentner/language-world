    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed sideways  2. Lift the peg out  3. Pull the peg out
    First, line up the gripper with the side of the peg. We don't need to be exact, just line it up roughly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not laterally aligned with the peg, the robot should line up gripper along side of peg.
    Once we're roughly aligned, we can lift it out by slowly moving the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is laterally aligned with the peg and the peg is still inside the hole, the robot should lift the peg out.
    Once the peg comes out a little, we can pull it out.
    - When the robot's gripper is laterally aligned with the peg and the peg is out of the hole, the robot should pull peg out.
