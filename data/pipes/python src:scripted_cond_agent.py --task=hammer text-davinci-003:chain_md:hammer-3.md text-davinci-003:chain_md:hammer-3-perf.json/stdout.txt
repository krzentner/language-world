Steps:  1. Put gripper near hammer  2. Grab the hammer  3. Put the hammer close to the nail  4. Swing hammer in a downwards direction to hit the nail
    First, we need to put the gripper near the hammer in order to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the hammer, the robot should put gripper near hammer.
    Once the gripper is near the hammer, close the gripper to grab the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hammer and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the hammer.
    Now that the robot has the hammer, put the hammer close to the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the nail and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should put hammer near nail.
    Finally, swing the hammer in a downwards direction to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the nail and the hammer is below the nail, the robot should swing hammer downwards.
