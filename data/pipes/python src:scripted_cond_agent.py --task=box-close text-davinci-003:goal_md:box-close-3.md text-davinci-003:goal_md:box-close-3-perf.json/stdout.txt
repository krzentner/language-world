    Steps:  1. Put robot's gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the robot's gripper  3. Move the lid to the box's opening  4. Place the lid on the box 
    First, put the robot's gripper above the box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the box lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box's opening
    Once the robot's gripper is above the box's opening, it can lower down and place the lid on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box's opening, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the box's opening
