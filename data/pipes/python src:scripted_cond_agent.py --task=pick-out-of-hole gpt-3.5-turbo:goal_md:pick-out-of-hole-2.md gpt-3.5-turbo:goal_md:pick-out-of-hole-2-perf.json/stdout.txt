To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper into the hole, around the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole
    Once the gripper above the hole, put the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Close the gripper around the peg and lift it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is still in the hole, lift the robot's gripper to pull the peg out of the hole and make sure the peg is securely held by the gripper.
    Once the peg is safely in the gripper, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the peg is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
