Steps: 
1. Put gripper above mug
2. Drop gripper around mug
3. Close gripper around mug
4. Pull mug to target location

    #  3. Close gripper around mug

    # First, put the gripper roughly above mug, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.

    # the gripper.

    # to the target location.
