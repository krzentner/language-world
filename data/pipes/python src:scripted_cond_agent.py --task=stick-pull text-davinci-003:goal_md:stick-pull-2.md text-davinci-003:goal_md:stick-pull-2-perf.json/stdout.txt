    Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Pull the stick towards the thermos  4. Push the stick against the thermos to pull it to the target location
    First, put the gripper near the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now, we can use the gripper's force to pull the stick in toward the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now we can push the stick against the thermos to move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the target location
