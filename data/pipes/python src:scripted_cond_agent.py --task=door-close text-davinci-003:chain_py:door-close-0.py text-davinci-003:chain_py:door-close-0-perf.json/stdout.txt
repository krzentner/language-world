    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the door handle
    #  2. Align gripper with door handle
    #  3. Push the door closed
    # We need to be careful about the direction that we're moving the gripper
    # to push the door closed, since the robot's gripper won't be able to push
    # the door open from the closed position.
    # Move the robot's gripper left of the door handle.

    # Once it's near the door handle, we need to make sure it's lined up with the
    # handle.
    # We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large
    # and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
