    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the faucet  2. Drop the gripper around  the faucet  3. Turn the faucet right
    First, put the gripper roughly above the faucet, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet, the robot should put the gripper above faucet.
    If the gripper isn't around the faucet, put it around the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around faucet and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around faucet.
    Once the gripper is around the faucet, twist it towards the right direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet, the robot should twist faucet right.
