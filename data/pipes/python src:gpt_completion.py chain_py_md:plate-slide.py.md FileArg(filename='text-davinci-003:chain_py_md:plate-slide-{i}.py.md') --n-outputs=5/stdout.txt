Solution:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push plate into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to push it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # Once the gripper is above the plate, just push the plate into the target 
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
        robot.push("plate into the target location")
```


Steps:
1. Put gripper above plate
2. Push gripper into plate
3. Slide plate to goal

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, we should move it to the plate in order to start sliding it.

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
    
Once the gripper is over the plate, we can start pushing down to get control of it.

if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not in the plate"):
    robot.push("gripper into plate")
    
Once the gripper is trapping the plate, we can start sliding it to the goal.

if check("the robot's gripper is in the plate"):
    robot.slide("plate to the goal")


Steps: 
 1. Put gripper below plate
 2. Push the plate onto the goal

# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper below plate
    #  2. Push the plate onto the goal
    # First, put the gripper below the plate
    if check("the robot's gripper is not below plate"):
        robot.put("gripper below plate")
    # If the gripper is near the plate, we can start pushing it onto the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near plate"):
        robot.push("plate onto goal")


The program should read:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Grab plate with the gripper
    #  3. Slide plate to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the plate is left of the gripper, grab the plate.
    if check("the plate is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    # If the gripper is near the plate, we can start to slide the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
        robot.slide("plate to the goal")
```


The robot needs to slide a plate into a target location.

Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the plate
  2. Drop gripper around the plate
  3. Slide the plate to target location
  
 # plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
 # def plate_slide(robot):
    # steps:
    # 1. put gripper above plate
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # 2. Drop gripper around plate
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    # 3. Slide the plate to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate"):
        robot.slide("plate to target location")
