    Steps:  1. Position gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around ball  3. Close gripper around ball  4. Move robot with gripper towards the hoop  5. Shoot ball towards the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place gripper above ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around ball.
    Once the gripper is around the ball, close it to make sure we securely have it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around ball.
    Move the robot with the ball towards the hoop at a reasonable angle and speed.
    - When the robot is near the hoop, the robot should shoot the ball towards the hoop.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball  3. Reach forward with the gripper to start the ball moving  4. Swoop the ball up and move toward the goal  5. Slam dunk the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place gripper above the ball.
    Then, drop the gripper around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the ball.
    Start pushing the ball with the gripper forward.
    - When robot's gripper is around the ball and the robot's gripper is pushing forward, the robot should start the ball moving.
    Then, scoop up the ball and move toward the goal.
    - When robot's gripper is pushing the ball forward, the robot should move the ball toward goal.
    Finally, slam dunk the ball into the hoop. Confirm that the ball went in.
    - When the ball is near the hoop, the robot should slam the ball into the hoop.


    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the basketball  2. Position the basketball under the hoop  3. Lift the basketball up and release over the hoop  4. Drop the basketball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper around the basketball to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around basketball, the robot should move gripper around basketball.
    Once the gripper is around the basketball, slowly position it under the hoop, using the gripper as a stabilizer.
    - When the basketball is not under the hoop and the robot's gripper is not in the center of the basketball, the robot should position basketball under the hoop.
    Then, lift the basketball up and release it over the hoop.
    - When the basketball is under the hoop and the robot's gripper is in the center of the basketball, the robot should lift the basketball up and release it over the hoop.
    Finally, drop the basketball into the hoop.
    - When the basketball is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is in the center of the basketball, the robot should drop the basketball into the hoop.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the basketball  2. Move gripper to the left of the hoop  3. Lift the ball slightly off the ground  4. Aim the ball towards the hoop  5. Throw the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the basketball. From this view, make sure the gripper is as small as possible so that we have the best shot at trying to throw it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the basketball, the robot should put gripper above basketball.
    Move the gripper to the left of the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is not to the left of the hoop, the robot should move gripper to the left of the hoop.
    Lift the ball slightly off the ground so that we can see where we want to throw it.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the left of the hoop and the ball is still on the ground, the robot should lift ball slightly off the ground.
    Now that the ball is off the ground, we can aim the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper has lifted the ball off the ground, the robot should aim ball towards hoop.
    Finally, throw the ball into the hoop.
    - When robot's gripper is aiming ball towards hoop, the robot should throw ball into hoop.

    Steps:  1. Move the robot's gripper to the ball  2. Close the gripper to pick up the ball  3. Move the robot's gripper to the hoop  4. Line the ball up in front of the hoop  5. Push the ball into the hoop
    First, move the gripper to the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the ball, the robot should move gripper towards ball.
    If the gripper is near the ball, close the gripper to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around ball.
    If the ball is held by the gripper, move the gripper to the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding ball and the ball is not lined up with hoop, the robot should move gripper towards hoop.
    As long as the ball is aligned with the hoop, we can just slide it in. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hoop and the ball is aligned with the hoop, the robot should push ball into hoop.
