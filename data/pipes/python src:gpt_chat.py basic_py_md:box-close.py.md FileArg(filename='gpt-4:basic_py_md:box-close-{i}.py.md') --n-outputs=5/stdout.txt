Sure, here's the program to perform `box-close` task:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.reach("the gripper above the box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("the gripper around the box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the box lid")
        robot.lift("the box lid")
    if check("the box lid is lifted and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the box"):
        robot.put("the box lid on the box")
```

This program first checks if the gripper is above the box lid, and then checks if it is around the lid and is open. If both conditions are met, the gripper closes and lifts the lid. Then, the program checks if the lifted lid and the gripper are vertically aligned with the box. If the conditions are met, the gripper places the lid on that box.
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.reach("to the box lid")
        robot.place("gripper above the box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around the box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("the box lid on the box") 

# Check function to provide context to the states
def check(state):
    print(f"Checking if {state}")
    return True    # Replace with actual code to check if the state is true
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.place("gripper above box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on box")
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.place("gripper above box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on the box")
Sure thing! Here's a program to perform the `box-close` task:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.place("gripper above box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on box")
``` 

Note that the `check` function is not defined in the provided code, so you would need to define it yourself or use a different method to check the robot's position and state. Additionally, this code assumes that the robot knows the location of the box and its lid. If the robot needs to first locate the box and/or lid, additional code would need to be added to the program.
