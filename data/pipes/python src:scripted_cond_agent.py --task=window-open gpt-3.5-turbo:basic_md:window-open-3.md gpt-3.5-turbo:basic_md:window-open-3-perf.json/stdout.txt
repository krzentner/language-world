To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to the right of the window handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide the window to the left.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push the window to the left harder.
