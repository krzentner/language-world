# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above stick
    #  2. Drop gripper around stick
    #  3. Close gripper around stick
    #  4. Put the end of the stick into the thermos handle
    #  5. Push the stick to make it into the thermos handle
    #  6. Lift the stick with the thermos handle and slide the thermos to the goal
    # First, put the gripper above the stick.

    # the gripper.

    # If we didn't grab the thermos, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
