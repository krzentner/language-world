    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Drop gripper around the button  3. Push the button
    First, put the gripper roughly above the button, so that we don't bump it while trying to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should place gripper above button.
    If the gripper isn't around the button, put it around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around button and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around button.
    If the gripper is near the button and open, maybe we can press it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near button and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around button.
    We closed the gripper, and the button is still near the gripper, so maybe we pressed it. Try to push the button. If we didn't press it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above button and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push button.
