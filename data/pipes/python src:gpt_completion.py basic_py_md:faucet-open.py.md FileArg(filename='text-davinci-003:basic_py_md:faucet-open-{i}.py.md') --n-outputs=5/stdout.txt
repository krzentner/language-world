Here's the proposed solution:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not close to the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with faucet handle"):
        robot.rotate("gripper clockwise")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```


if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the faucet handle"):
    robot.put("gripper near to faucet handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle"):
    robot.grab("faucet handle")
if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
    robot.turn("anti-clockwise to open the faucet")


The program should be as follows:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around faucet")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```


Here is the finished code:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle but not around the faucet handle"):
        robot.grab("faucet handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```


```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the faucet"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet"):
        robot.grab("faucet handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```
