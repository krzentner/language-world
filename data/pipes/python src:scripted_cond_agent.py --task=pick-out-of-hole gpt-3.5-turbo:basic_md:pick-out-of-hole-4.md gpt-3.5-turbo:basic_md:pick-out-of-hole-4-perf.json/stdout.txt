To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hole and the peg is still in the hole, the robot should insert the gripper into the hole and grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper has successfully grabbed the peg, the robot should lift the gripper out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the peg at the target location.
