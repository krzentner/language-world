    Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Reach towards the target bin  4. Place the cube into the bin
    To reach for the cube, move the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, the robot should reach towards cube.
    When the gripper is near the cube, close it so it can grip the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab cube.
    To reach for the target bin, move the gripper above the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near target bin, the robot should reach towards target bin.
    Once the gripper is above the bin, open it so it can place the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is near target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place cube into bin.
