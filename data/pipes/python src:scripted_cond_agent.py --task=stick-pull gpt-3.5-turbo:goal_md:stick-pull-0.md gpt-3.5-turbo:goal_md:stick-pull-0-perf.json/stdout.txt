To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Position the robot's gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the gripper until it's above the stick
2. Grab the stick with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Position the gripper above the thermos without knocking it over.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos and not vertically aligned with the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos and vertically aligned with the thermos
4. Use the stick to hook onto the thermos handle from above.
5. Pull the stick towards the robot to pull the thermos towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until it's above the target location
6. Release the thermos by opening the gripper.
