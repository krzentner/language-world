To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper roughly above the wrench and peg  2. Open the gripper and drop the wrench onto the peg  3. Close the gripper around the peg and wrench to tighten the grip
    First, put the gripper roughly above both the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench and peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and peg
    Open the gripper and drop the wrench onto the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and peg and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and peg, open the robot's gripper and move it down to drop the wrench onto the peg
    Close the gripper around the peg and wrench to tighten the grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and peg, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is tightly closed around the wrench and peg
