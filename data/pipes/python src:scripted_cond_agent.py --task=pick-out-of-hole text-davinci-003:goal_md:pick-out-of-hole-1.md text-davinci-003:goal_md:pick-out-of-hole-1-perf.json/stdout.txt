    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the peg  2. Line up the gripper with the sides of the peg  3. Move upwards, gripping the peg  4. Move the peg to the target location
    First, we need to put the gripper below the peg so that the peg is supported by the gripper when the robot is lifting it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the peg
    Then, line up the robot's gripper with the sides of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once we have a good grip on the peg, move upwards and away from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
