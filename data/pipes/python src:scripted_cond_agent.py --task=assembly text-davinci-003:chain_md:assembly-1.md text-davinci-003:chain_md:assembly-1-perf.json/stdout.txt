    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the wrench up with the peg  4. Slide the wrench around the peg 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    Once the gripper is near the peg, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around peg.
    Align the wrench with the peg to slide the wrench around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with peg, the robot should align wrench with peg.
    Slide the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the wrench is horizontally aligned with peg, the robot should slide wrench around peg.
