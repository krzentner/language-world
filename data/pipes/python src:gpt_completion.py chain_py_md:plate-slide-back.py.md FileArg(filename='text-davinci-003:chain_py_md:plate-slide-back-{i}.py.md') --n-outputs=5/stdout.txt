The program should do the following steps:

1. Put gripper above plate.
2. Drop gripper around plate.
3. Push the plate back to its target location.

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Drop gripper around plate
    #  3. Push the plate back to its target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the plate is beneath the gripper as seen from above, line the gripper up 
    # around the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    # Once the gripper is around the plate, we can just push it back to its target
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around plate"):
        robot.push("plate back to target")
```


The robot can slide the plate back into the target location by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper.

If the plate isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the plate.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the plate")
```

If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, move the gripper down to the plate to slide it.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the plate")
```

If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the plate.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the plate to the target location")
```


The final code should look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push the plate back into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate so we can try to grab it
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # Once the gripper is above the plate, we can grab it and slide it back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    # Once the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it to the target
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("plate back to target location")
```


The robot needs to slide the plate back into the target location using its gripper.

# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Line the plate up with the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate back into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the plate.
    # Because the plate is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined
    # up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.align("plate to target location")
    # If the plate is lined up with the target location, slide it back into it.
    if check("plate is horizontally aligned with target location"):
        robot.slide("plate back into target location")


Steps: 
1. Put the gripper above the plate
2. Push the plate back into the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move it to the plate.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.put("the gripper above the plate")

If the robot's gripper is above the plate, slide it back into the target location.
if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate"):
    robot.slide("the plate back into the target location")
