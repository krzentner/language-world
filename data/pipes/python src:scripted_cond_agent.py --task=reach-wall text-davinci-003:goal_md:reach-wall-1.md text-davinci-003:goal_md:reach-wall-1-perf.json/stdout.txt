Steps:  1. Reach towards the beginning of the wall  2. Push to move the robot's gripper over the wall  3. Reach to the target location
    The robot can reach over the wall, so it should start by reaching towards the beginning of the wall. 
- When the robot's gripper is not near the beginning of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the beginning of the wall
Once the gripper is near the beginning of the wall, it should push over the wall towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the beginning of the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall and the robot's gripper is near the target
