Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the wall  2. Move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the short wall  3. Put the robot's gripper above the button  4. Push down the button from the top
    We need to go around the wall to line up the gripper with the button, so put the gripper around the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wall
    If the gripper is lined up with the wall, move it above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Now move the gripper above the button so that it's lined up when viewed from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
