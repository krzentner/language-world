- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the gripper is not around cube, the robot should extend gripper around cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near cube, the robot should move laterally in the direction of the target location and sweep the cube.
