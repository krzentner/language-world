    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the cube and closed, we can move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the cube is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
