    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the handle  2. Grip the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper left of the handle, so that it can grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is left of the handle, we can grab the handle by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    If the gripper is near the handle, we can pull up the handle by moving the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
