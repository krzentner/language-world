    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the handle becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the handle. Because the handle is a small object, check if the gripper is around it from the front instead of just lined up.
    - When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up and closed around the handle, we can pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
