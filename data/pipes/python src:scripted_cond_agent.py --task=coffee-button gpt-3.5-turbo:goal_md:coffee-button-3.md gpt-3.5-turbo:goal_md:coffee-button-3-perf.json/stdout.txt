To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the gripper above the coffee machine button  2. Move the gripper down to touch the button  3. Push the button down to activate the coffee maker
First, position the gripper above the coffee machine button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is aligned with the button, move the gripper down to touch the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button but not touching it, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the button
Finally, push down on the button to activate the coffee machine.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the button, push down on the button to activate the coffee machine.
