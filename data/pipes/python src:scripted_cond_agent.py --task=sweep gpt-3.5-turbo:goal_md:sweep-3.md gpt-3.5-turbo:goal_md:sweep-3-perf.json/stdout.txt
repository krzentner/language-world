To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Open gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Lift the cube up slightly  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Lower the cube onto the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Open the gripper around the cube to grip it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube
    Close the gripper around the cube to hold it securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, close the gripper around the cube
    Lift the cube up slightly to clear the surface.
    - When the gripper is closed around the cube, lift the cube up slightly
    Move the gripper to the target location while keeping a firm grip on the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and is not near to the target location, move the robot's gripper to the target location
    Lower the cube onto the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, lower the cube onto the target location
