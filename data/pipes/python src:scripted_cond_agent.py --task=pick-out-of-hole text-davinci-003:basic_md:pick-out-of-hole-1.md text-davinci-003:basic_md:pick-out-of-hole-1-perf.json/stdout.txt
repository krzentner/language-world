The robot should perform the following steps: 
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper down above peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is not near peg, the robot should move the gripper closer to the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is still in hole, the robot should lift peg out of hole.
   - When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is above hole, the robot should place peg at goal.
