To slide the plate back into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Lift the plate off the table  4. Move gripper to target location  5. Slide the plate onto the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate or open, move it near and close it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate but not near it, or the robot's gripper is open but above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper has grabbed the plate, lift it off the table.
    - When the robot's gripper has the plate but is not lifted off the table, lift the plate off the table
    Move the gripper holding the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Slide the plate off the gripper and onto the target location.
    - Once the robot's gripper is above the target location, slide the plate onto the target location
