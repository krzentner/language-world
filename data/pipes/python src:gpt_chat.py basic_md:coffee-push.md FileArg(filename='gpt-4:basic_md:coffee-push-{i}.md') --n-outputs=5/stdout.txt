To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the gripper is not above the mug, the robot should move the gripper above the mug.
   - When the gripper is above the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
   - When the gripper is holding the mug and the mug is not near the target location, the robot should move the gripper and mug to the target location.
   - When the gripper and mug are at the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the mug.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably for the task `coffee-push`, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should move the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should lift the mug and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should release the mug at the target location.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably in the `coffee-push` task, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle of the mug, the robot should put the gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug by the handle and the mug is not above the target location, the robot should lift the mug.
- When the mug is above the target location, the robot should move the gripper and the mug towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the mug to the target location and release the grip on it.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug and the mug is not near the target location, the robot should lift the mug and move it towards the target location.
- When the mug is near the target location, the robot should place the mug at the target location by opening the gripper.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps for the `coffee-push` task:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should lift the mug and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should open the gripper and release the mug. 

It is important to ensure that the gripper holds the mug with enough pressure to prevent the mug from slipping while lifting or moving it, but not too much pressure that it could damage the mug. Also, the robot should make sure to move the mug slowly and steadily to avoid any spills or accidents.
