To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Close gripper around soccer ball  4. Push the ball towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it towards the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper and the soccer ball are horizontally aligned with the target location. Then, move the robot's gripper towards the target location to push the soccer ball.
To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball  2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper towards the target location while pushing the soccer ball in front of it  4. Release the soccer ball at the target location
First, we will put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball
If the gripper is not around the soccer ball, then grab the soccer ball with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
Move the gripper towards the target location while pushing the soccer ball in front of it until it reaches the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while pushing the soccer ball
Finally, release the soccer ball at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, release the soccer ball by opening the gripper.
To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around the soccer ball  3. Close gripper around the soccer ball  4. Move the soccer ball to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and closed, maybe we can push the soccer ball to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the target location
    If the gripper is close to the target location, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it to the target. Open the gripper to release the soccer ball in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the target location while holding the soccer ball, open the gripper to release the soccer ball in the target location.
To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Close gripper around soccer ball  4. Move soccer ball to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and closed, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location. Finally, open the gripper to let go of the soccer ball at the target location.
To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Line the ball up with the target location  4. Push the ball towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper is not around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the ball, line it up with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the ball is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Once the gripper is lined up with the ball and the target location, push the ball towards the target location.
    - When the ball is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location with the ball still in the gripper.
