To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
2. Open the gripper and lower it around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper and lower it around the cube.
3. Close the gripper to grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper to grab the cube.
4. Lift and move the cube towards the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should lift it and move it towards the target bin.
5. Lower the cube into the bin and release the gripper to drop it.
- When the cube is above the target bin, the robot should lower it into the bin and release the gripper to drop it. 
6. Move the gripper away from the cube and bin.
- When the cube is in the bin and the gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper away from the cube and the bin.
