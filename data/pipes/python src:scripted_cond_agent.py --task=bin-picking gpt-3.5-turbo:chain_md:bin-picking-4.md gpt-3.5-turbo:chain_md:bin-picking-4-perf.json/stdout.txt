To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Lift the cube  4. Move the cube to the target bin  5. Release the cube into the target bin
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the cube is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should attempt to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the cube.
    Once the cube is in the gripper, lift the cube and move it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and holding the cube, the robot should lift the cube and move it to the target bin.
    Once the cube is above the target bin, release the gripper to drop the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, the robot should release the cube into the target bin.
