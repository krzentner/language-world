Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.

The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.

The task `push` requires the robot to slide the puck to the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the door handle, it's being opened, so keep pulling.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull door open.

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.

The task `faucet-close` requires the robot to turn the faucet right.
To turn the faucet right reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
