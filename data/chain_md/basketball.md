Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `pick-place` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.

The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window left.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window left harder.

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
    If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.

The task `basketball` requires the robot to put the ball into into the hoop.
To put the ball into into the hoop reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
