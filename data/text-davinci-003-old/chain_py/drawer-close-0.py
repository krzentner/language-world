    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle
    #  2. Push the drawer closed
    # If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer
    # handle.
    # We don't have to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is
    # large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    # If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can
    # push the drawer closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")
