    #  1. Put gripper above cube
    #  2. Grab cube with gripper
    #  3. Sweep cube into goal
    # First, put the gripper above the cube, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.sweep("gripper around cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to sweep the cube to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
