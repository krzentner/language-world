    #  1. Put gripper above drawer handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
    #  3. Pull open the drawer
    # First, put the gripper above the drawer handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to
    # grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer
    # open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")
