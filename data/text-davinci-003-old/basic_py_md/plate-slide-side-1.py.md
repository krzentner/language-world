Solution:

```
# plate-slide-side: slide the plate sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.place("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the goal"):
        robot.align("plate to goal")
    if check("the plate is horizontally aligned with the goal and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
```
