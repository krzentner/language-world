Here's the proposed solution:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not close to the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above faucet handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with faucet handle"):
        robot.rotate("gripper clockwise")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle"):
        robot.turn("faucet left")
```
