This code should:

if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube"):
    robot.put("gripper on top of cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not near cube"):
    robot.move("gripper closer to cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.drop("gripper around cube")
if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.sweep("cube to goal")
