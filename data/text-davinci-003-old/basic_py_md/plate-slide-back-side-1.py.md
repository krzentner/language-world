```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.place("gripper above plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not at the goal"):
        robot.slide("plate to goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is at the goal"):
        robot.release("plate")
```
