Solution:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.place("gripper above hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the hole and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper into hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in the hole and the peg is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("peg at goal")
```
