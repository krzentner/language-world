```
# stick-pull: use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location
# def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near stick and the robot's gripper is not above stick"):
        robot.put("gripper near stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near thermos and the thermos is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("stick under thermos")
    if check("the stick is under the thermos"):
        robot.pull("thermos to goal")
