The code should read as follows:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
# def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench"):
        robot.reach("to wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the wrench"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is not near the peg"):
        robot.pull("wrench away from peg")
```
