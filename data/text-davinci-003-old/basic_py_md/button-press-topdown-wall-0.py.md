The code should be:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and there is a wall in the way"):
        robot.move("gripper above the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
```
