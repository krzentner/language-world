Then add the following code so that the robot can successfully put the ball into the hoop:
```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not directly below the basket"):
        robot.put("gripper below basket")
    if check("the robot's gripper is directly below the basket and the robot's gripper is not near the ball"):
        robot.drop("gripper around ball")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near ball and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the hoop"):
        robot.align("gripper with hoop")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.push("ball into the hoop")
```
