Here is the program:
 
# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("cube sideways to goal")
    if check("the cube is near the goal and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.drop("cube at goal")
