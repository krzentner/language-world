The steps the robot should perform to push the soccer ball into the target location reliably are:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not in front of soccer ball, the robot should move gripper in front of soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of soccer ball, the robot should push soccer ball to goal.
