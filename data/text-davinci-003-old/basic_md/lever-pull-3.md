    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not around lever, the robot should put gripper around lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, the robot should rotate lever up.
