The robot should perform the following steps to pick up the peg out of the hole reliably: 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should place gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should place the puck at the goal.
