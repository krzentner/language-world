    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Drop gripper around the button  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the gripper above the button so that we don't miss the button by pushing too far. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    If the gripper isn't around the button, put it around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the button, push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is around button and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
