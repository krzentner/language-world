    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Move gripper around wall  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Move puck to goal
    First, we need to get the gripper above the puck. This can be difficult depending on the height of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the wall
    We can now move the robotic gripper to the other side of the wall. This can be difficult depending on its height.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall and is oriented toward the puck
    Once the gripper is above the wall and oriented toward the puck, move it until the gripper is above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
