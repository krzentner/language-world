    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop the gripper around the handle  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the handle is too far away to grab, move the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
