    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push gripper down onto ball  3. Push soccer ball to goal 
    First, we need to put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper is high enough above the soccer ball, close it to grab the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is closed, we can push the soccer ball towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
