    Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the soccer ball  2. Push the soccer ball into the target location
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball
    Once the gripper is near the soccer ball, push it into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
