    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Drop gripper around the ball  3. Push the ball towards the hoop  4. Release the grip when the ball is close to the hoop   
    First, put the gripper roughly above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    We need to grab the ball to push it. Once the gripper is around the ball, close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now we move the ball towards the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the hoop and the robot is releasing the grip on the ball
    Once the ball is close to the hoop, release the grip so it can shoot it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the hoop and the robot is gripping the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is releasing the grip on the ball
