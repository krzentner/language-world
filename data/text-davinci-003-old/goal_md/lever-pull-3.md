   Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the bottom of the lever  2. Push up on the lever as high as possible  3. Move the gripper around lever to get better purchase  4. Pull up on lever to rotate it up
   We need to line up the gripper with the bottom of the lever so that it can get some purchase.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever's bottom, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever's bottom
   If the gripper is lined up with the lever, we can now push up on the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever's bottom, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever 
   If the gripper is still vertically aligned with the lever's bottom, move the gripper around the lever to get better purchase.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever
   If the gripper is around the lever, we can pull up on it to rotate it.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
