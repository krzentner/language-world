    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Line up gripper with the dial  3. Grab the dial  4. Turn dial
    We should move the robot's gripper near the door handle to start turning the dial. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the door handle
    If the robot can see the dial, it should move the gripper until it's lined up with the dial before grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above door handle and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed.
    Now that the robot's gripper is lined up, just grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial 
   If the robot's gripper is around the dial it, can start turning the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the desired position of the dial
