    Steps: 1. Move the gripper to the top of the wall  2. Put the gripper on one side of the puck  3. Push the puck against the wall 4. Push the puck towards the target location 
    First, move the gripper to the top of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the top of the wall
    If the gripper is close to the wall, put the gripper on one side of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on one side of the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is on one side of the puck
    Now we can push the puck against the wall, to get it stuck.
    - When the robot's gripper is on one side of the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wall
    If the puck is stuck against the wall, we can push it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
