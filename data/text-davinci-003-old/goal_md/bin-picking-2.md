    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube to goal  5. Drop cube into bin
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can move it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin
    If the gripper is near the target bin, we can drop the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the cube is inside the bin and the robot's gripper is open
