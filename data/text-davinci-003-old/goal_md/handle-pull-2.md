    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull handle up
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle, so that we can align it properly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, just pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
