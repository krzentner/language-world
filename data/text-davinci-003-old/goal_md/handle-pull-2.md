    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can start pulling it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
