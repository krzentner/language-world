    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push the puck with one finger of the robot's gripper  3. Slide puck to goal
    We want to be able to gently sliding the puck back, so we'll just start by putting the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    Now that the gripper is above the puck, we can just slide the puck back by pushing on it with one finger of the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
