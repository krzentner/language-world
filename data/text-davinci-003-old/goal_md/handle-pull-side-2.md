    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the side of the handle  2. Rotationally move gripper onto handle  3. Pull up the handle with the gripper 
    If the robotâ€™s gripper is not on the side of the handle, we should move the gripper near the handle  
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the handle, we can rotate the gripper to put it onto the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    If the robot's gripper is around the handle, we can pull up the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
