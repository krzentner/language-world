    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Line up gripper from above  3. Push down on the button from the top while avoiding the wall
    We need to line up the gripper from above, so we have to be careful of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not blocked by the wall
    Once the gripper is above the button, make sure it's lined up with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not blocked by the wall
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not blocked by the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
