    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Drop gripper around the plate  3. Slide the plate back  4. Lift the plate up
    First, put the gripper roughly above plate, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Once the gripper is near the target location and the plate is below the gripper, lift the plate up.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the plate is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is higher than the target location
