    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push back on the plate  3. Slide the plate back into the target location
    We need to line up the gripper with the plate from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can just push back on the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    If the plate is aligned with the target location, we can slide it back in.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
