    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Drop gripper into the hole  3. Line gripper up with peg  4. Close gripper around the peg 5. Lift peg out the hole 6. Move peg to target location
    First, move the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
    If the hole is lined up with the gripper seen from above, we can drop the gripper into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is not in the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the hole
    If the gripper is in the hole, check if the gripper is lined up with the peg as seen from below.
    - When the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the peg is aligned with the gripper, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
