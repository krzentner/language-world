    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Put gripper around the plate  3. Slide the plate back into the target location 
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once the robot's gripper is lined up, we can grab the plate by moving the gripper around it. If the plate isn't below the gripper, move the gripper until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    We can now slide the plate back in.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not close to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is near the target location
