    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever  2. Pull the lever up  3. Secure the lever in the up position
    First put the gripper above the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever
    Once the gripper is lined up above the lever, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is still near the lever, check if we've pulled it up enough.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the lever and the lever is not up, move the robot's gripper until the lever is up and the robot's gripper is closed
