Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Push the plate sideways until it meets the wall  3. Slide the plate back until it reaches the target location
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
Once the gripper is above the plate we can start pushing the plate to the side.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is adjacent to the wall
Once the plate is next to the wall, it limits its movement in one direction. We can now slide the plate back to the target location.
- When the plate is adjacent to the wall and the plate is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is near the target location.
