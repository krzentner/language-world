    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Line up the handle  3. Push down on the handle
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can line it up, since we're pushing it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, line up the handle so that it's positioned correctly.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    If the handle is aligned with the gripper on the side, push down on the handle to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
