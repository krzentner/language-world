    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the handle becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the handle. Because the handle is a small object, check if the gripper is around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull up the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
