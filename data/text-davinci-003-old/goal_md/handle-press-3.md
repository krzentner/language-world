    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down the handle
    First, put the gripper roughly above the handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertical alignment with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the gripper isn't around the handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the handle, just push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
