    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move the cube sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
    If the gripper is lined up next to the target location, we can slide the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the cube is near the target location
