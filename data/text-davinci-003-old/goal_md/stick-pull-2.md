    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Drop gripper around the stick  3. Push the stick so it is between the gripper and the thermos  4. Pull the thermos to the target location
    We need to put the gripper above the stick before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
    Once the gripper is lined up above the stick, we should be able to grab the stick by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick
    Once the gripper is around the stick, push the stick so it's between the gripper and the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is not between the robot's gripper and the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is between the robot's gripper and the thermos
    If the stick is between the gripper and the thermos, we can just pull the thermos to the target location.
    - When the stick is between the robot's gripper and the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
