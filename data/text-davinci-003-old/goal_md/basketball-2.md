    Steps:  1. Put gripper over the ball  2. Line up the ball with the hoop  3. Drop the ball in the hoop
    First, put the gripper roughly over the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the ball isn't lined up with the hoop, we should line it up by moving gripper forward and back.
    - When the ball is not almost aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper until the ball is almost always aligned with the hoop and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the ball is lined up with the hoop, just drop the ball in the hoop.
    - When the ball is aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the ball
