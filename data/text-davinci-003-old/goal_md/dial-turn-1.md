    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Line up the robot's gripper with the dial  3. Grip the dial and rotate
    Before the robot can turn the dial, we need to move the gripper near the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is near the dial, we'll need to line up the gripper with the dial before we can grip and turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the robot's gripper is aligned with the dial, grip it and turn it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
