    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Reach down and grab the cube  3. Move the cube to the bin  4. Drop the cube into the bin
    First, put the gripper roughly above cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the bin.
    If the bin is aligned with the gripper, drop the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the bin and the bin is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin.
