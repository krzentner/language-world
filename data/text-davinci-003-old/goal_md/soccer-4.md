    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the soccer ball  2. Push the soccer ball forward  3. Retarget the robot's gripper
    First, put the gripper underneath the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not underneath the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is underneath the soccer ball
    If the gripper is underneath the soccer ball and still open, hold the soccer ball to minimize movement.
    - When the robot's gripper is underneath soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the soccer ball 
    We should be able to push the soccer ball forward once it's lined up with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is after the soccer ball is moved to the target location
    When the soccer ball is close to the target, it's important to reset the gripper position quickly so you can move the ball closer.
    - When the soccer ball is close to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is after the soccer ball is moved to the target location
