    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the robot's gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle, drop the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed around the handle
    Now that the gripper is closed around the handle, we should be able to push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle
