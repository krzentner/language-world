    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the handle counter-clockwise
    First, put the gripper above the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the faucet
    If the robot's gripper is above the faucet but not near, move the gripper down until it's near the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is above faucet and the robot's gripper is not near faucet, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet and the robot's gripper is closed 
    Now that the gripper is near the faucet, we can rotate the handle counter-clockwise to turn on the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet, move the robot's gripper until the handle is turned counter-clockwise
