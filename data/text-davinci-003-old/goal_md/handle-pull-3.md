    Steps:  1. Put gripper below handle  2. Grab handle with gripper  3. Pull up handle
    First, put the gripper below the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    By grabbing the handle with the gripper, we can easily pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
