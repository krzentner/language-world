    Steps: 1. Put gripper above handle  2. Lower gripper around handle  3. Pull up on handle
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
