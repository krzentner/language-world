    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door lock  2. Grab the door lock with the gripper  3. Turn the dial to the desired location 
    First, put the gripper above the door lock.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door lock, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door lock
    If the door lock becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the door lock. Because the door lock is a small object, check if the gripper is around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around door lock and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door lock and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still around the door lock, turn the dial to the desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door lock and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the desired location
