    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly behind puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck
    If the gripper isn't behind the puck, put it behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
