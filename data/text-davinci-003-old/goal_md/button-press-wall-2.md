    If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    If the robot's gripper is roughly aligned with the button and the short wall is still between the robot's gripper and the button, try to reach around the wall to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the short wall is between the robot's gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
