    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Move the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    When the gripper is above the plate, move the plate sideways until it is in the desired location.
    - When the plate is directly above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the plate 
    Now that the plate is in the desired position, the robot can move left to move the plate sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
