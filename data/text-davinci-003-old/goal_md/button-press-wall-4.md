Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Put gripper against the wall  3. Push the button 
    First, put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    If the gripper is high enough from the button, we can put it against the wall so that it can reach the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not against the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is against the wall
    Once the gripper is pressed against the wall, we can push the button without needing to move the gripper farther away.
    - When the robot's gripper is against the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
