    Steps:  1. Put gripper above hammer handle  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper  3. Line the hammer up with the nail  4. Swing the hammer down onto the nail
    First, put the gripper above the hammer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer handle
    If the hammer is left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the hammer handle.
    - When the hammer is not left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is closed around the hammer, we can move it and line it up with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hammer handle and the hammer is not horizontally aligned with nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail
    When the hammer is lined up with the nail, swing the hammer down.
    - When the hammer is horizontally aligned with nail and the hammer is not above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is above the nail
