Steps:  1. Put gripper around the puck  2. Lift the puck up  3. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the puck, we can lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    Now that the puck is lifted up, we can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
