    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the puck  2. Close grip around the puck  3. Move to the target location  4. Release the grip
    First, put the gripper around the puck. Make sure the robot's gripper is closed so the objects don't reject the robot's grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is above the puck and closed, we've probably trapped the puck and can move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Once the gripper is near the target, release the grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open
