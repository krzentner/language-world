    Steps:  1. Put gripper loosely around peg  2. Pull up the peg  3. Move the peg to target Location 
    To pick up the peg, we first need to put the gripper loosely around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open
    Now that the gripper is nearby, the robot needs to lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    The peg should now be held in the gripper, so let's move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
