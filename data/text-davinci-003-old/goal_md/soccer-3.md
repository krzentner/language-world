    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push into the top of soccer ball  3. Slide soccer ball towards target location
    We need to move the gripper over the soccer ball before pushing it, so that we can accurately position it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    Once the gripper is above the soccer ball, we should push the gripper into the top of the soccer ball to get control of it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up with the soccer ball, we can slide it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near target location and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
