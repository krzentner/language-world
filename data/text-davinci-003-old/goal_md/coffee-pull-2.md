    Steps:  1. Put gripper directly above mug  2. Drop gripper closed around mug  3. Pull the mug to the target location
    We need to put the gripper above the mug before we can grab it, so that we don't knock it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is directly above the mug
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, drop it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the mug, we can probably grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the targetlocation
