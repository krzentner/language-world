    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Drop gripper around the dial  3. Turn the dial in the right direction  4. Release the dial
    First, put the gripper roughly above the dial, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
    If the gripper isn't around the dial, put it around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the dial and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial and the robot's gripper is closed, turn the dial in the correct direction
    Once the dial is turned, release the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
