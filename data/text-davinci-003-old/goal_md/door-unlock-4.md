Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Drop the gripper around the dial  3. Turn the dial to the right to unlock the door
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial
    Once the gripper is lined up above the dial, we should be able to grab the dial by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, we can just turn the dial to the right to unlock the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the dial and the robot is turning the dial to the right
