    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from the side  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    We need to line up the gripper from the side, so that the gripper can reach the handle. Line up the robot's gripper from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
