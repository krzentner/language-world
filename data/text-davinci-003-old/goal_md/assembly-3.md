    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Drop gripper around wrench handle  3. Put wrench around peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the wrench handle, we should be able to grab the wrench handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle
    If the wrench is aligned with the peg, we can just put the wrench around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle and the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is around the peg
