    Steps:  1.Put gripper near the wrench  2.Grab the wrench with gripper  3. Put gripper above the peg 4. Drop the wrench around the peg
    We need to put the gripper near the wrench before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wrench
    If the wrench becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper near the wrench. Check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is still around the wrench, bring the wrench above the peg.
    - When the wrench is forward aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the wrench is right above the peg, put the wrench around the peg and close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
