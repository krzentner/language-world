    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate  3. Slide the plate horizontally back into target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate. This will ensure that the gripper has enough clearance from the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate, close the gripper to make sure we have control of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
