    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the hole 
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg is near the gripper, grab the peg with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and peg is not left of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can just pull the peg out from the hole.
