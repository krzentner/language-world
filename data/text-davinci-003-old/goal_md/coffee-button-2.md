 
Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Push down on the button
    We need to carefully line up the gripper above the button because if the button sticks out at bit, we won't be able to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
