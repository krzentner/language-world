    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Move the peg out of the hole
    First, put the gripper to the side of the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is near the peg, we can try to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not out of the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Once we have a grip on the peg, we can move it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the peg is out of the hole
