Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Align the plate with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not roughly vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the robot's gripper isn't above the plate, check if the gripper is forward aligned with the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Once the plate is lined up with the target location, slide the plate into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
