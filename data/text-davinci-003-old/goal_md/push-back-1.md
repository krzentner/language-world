    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into back of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from the back and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't behind the gripper as seen from the back, move the gripper behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the target location
