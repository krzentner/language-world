    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle 2. Grab the handle with the gripper 3. Pull up the handle
    First, we should put the gripper above the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is not aligned with the gripper, we should line up the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the handle is not in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the handle is in front of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the handle is in front of the gripper, grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Now that the gripper is securely holding the handle, pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot is pulling up on the handle
