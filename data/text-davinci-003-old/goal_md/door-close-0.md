    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the door handle  2. Start pushing against the door handle to close the door  3. Push the door closed harder  4. Move door to the target location
    We should put the gripper left of the door handle so that we can start pushing against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the door handle we can probably slide the door close now by pushing against it from the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the door handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle
    Finally, move the door to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is slightly left of the target location
