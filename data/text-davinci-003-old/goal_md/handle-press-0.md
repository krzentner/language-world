Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Push down on the handle  3. Push the handle down harder
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is mostly lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    If the handle is aligned with the gripper as seen from above, we can push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not near handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
