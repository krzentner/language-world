    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Drop gripper around mug  3. Close the gripper around mug  4. Move the mug to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the mug and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
