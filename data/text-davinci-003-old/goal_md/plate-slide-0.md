Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Put gripper around plate  3. Slide the plate to the target location
The robot needs to put the gripper around the plate before it can slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
