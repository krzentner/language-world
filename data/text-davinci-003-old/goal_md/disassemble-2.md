    Steps:  1. Move robot's gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Push the wrench off the peg 
    First, move the gripper above the wrench so that it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now, grab the wrench by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not closed and the wrench is above the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is closed and the wrench is above it, we can push the wrench off the peg. 
    - When the wrench is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is pushed off the peg
