1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle 
2. Push the drawer closed

If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
