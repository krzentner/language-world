    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Line up gripper with button as seen from above  3. Push down on button with gripper  4. Push down on button with gripper until the wall is between the gripper and the button
    We need to line up the gripper from above, but the wall is in the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the wall is not between the gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is between the gripper and the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up and the wall is in the way, just push down on the button.
    - When the wall is between the gripper and the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
