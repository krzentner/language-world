    Steps:  1. Put the gripper on one side of the plate  2. Push the plate back until it is inside the target area  3. Move the plate back until it is in the target area
    First, put the gripper on one side of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near plate
    Once the robot's gripper is near the plate, we can push the plate back until it is inside the target area.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the plate is not inside the target area, move the robot's gripper until the plate is inside the target area
    Now that the plate is inside the target area, move the plate back until it is in the target area.
    - When the plate is inside the target area and the plate is not in the target area, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in the target area
