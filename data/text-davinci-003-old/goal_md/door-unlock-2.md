    If the gripper isn't around the dial, put it around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the dial and closed, we can turn the dial.
