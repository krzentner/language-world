    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push plate to target location
    The robot should first put the gripper above the plate, so that it can keep the plate in the correct orientation while pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the robot's gripper is above the plate, we can start pushing it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not toward the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is near the target location
