    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
    If the robot's gripper is above the mug, but not near it, move the gripper near the mug so that it can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not near the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the mug is trapped, we can just move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
