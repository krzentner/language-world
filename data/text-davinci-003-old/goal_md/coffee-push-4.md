    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Close gripper around mug  3. Move mug to goal
    First, the robot should put the gripper above the mug - when the robot's gripper is not above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug.
    Then, the robot should close the gripper to grab the mug - when the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed.
    Finally, the robot should move the mug to the goal - when the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is not near target location, move the robot's gripper until the mug is near the target location.
