    If the hammer is not near the nail, move the robot's gripper near the nail with the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the nail
    Once the gripper is close enough, tighten the gripper on the handle of the hammer and swing the hammer down towards the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is directly above the nail
    Finally, hit the nail with a sharp and short motion of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is directly above the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is forward aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is open
