    First, put the gripper above the dial.

    Now that the gripper is lined up, just grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, we can just turn the dial. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, move the robot's gripper until the dial is in the desired position
