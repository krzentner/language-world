    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial 
    For turning the dial, we need to move the robot's gripper close to the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    If the gripper is still open, we should be able to grab the dial by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the desired position
