    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push the puck against the wall  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving against the wall. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the robot's gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck, move the gripper to the wall and push against the wall until the wall is pushing the puck towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the wall is not pushing the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the wall is pushing the puck, we don't have direct control of the puck. Close the gripper to make sure we don't accidentally move it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the wall is pushing the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
