    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push the button down
    We need to move the gripper in front of the button before we can push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
