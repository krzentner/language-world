    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide the puck backward to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck backward by trapping it with the gripper,
    # pushing down on it from above, and then moving the gripper backward.
    # If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the puck")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper
    # down to the puck to slide it.

    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
