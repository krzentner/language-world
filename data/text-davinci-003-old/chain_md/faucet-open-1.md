    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Grab the faucet handle with the gripper  3. Move the handle counter-clockwise
    First, put the gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the faucet handle, we should be able to grab the faucet handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, the robot should grab faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can just move it counter clockwise to turn the faucet open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet handle, the robot should move handle counter-clockwise.
