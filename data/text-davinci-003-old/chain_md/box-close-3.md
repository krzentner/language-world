    Steps:  1. Put gripper above box lid  2. Drop gripper around box lid  3. Close gripper around box lid  4. Move box lid to box  5.Place box lid on box 
    First, put the gripper roughly above box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place gripper above box lid.
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around box lid.
    If the gripper is near the box lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around box lid.
    We closed the gripper, and the box lid is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the box lid to the box. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    -When the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move box lid to box.
    Once the box lid is at the box, simply place it on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is near box, the robot should place box lid on box.
