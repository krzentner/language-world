    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Drop gripper around cube  3. Close gripper around cube  4. Move cube sideways to goal 
    First, put the gripper above the cube, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
    Next, if the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around cube.
    Now that the gripper is in place, close the gripper to trap the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Finally, move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should move the cube sideways to the goal.
