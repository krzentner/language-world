    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the wrench, line up the peg with the wrench. 
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with wrench, the robot should align peg to wrench.
    If the peg is lined up with the wrench, pull the wrench off the peg.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with wrench, the robot should pull wrench off peg.
