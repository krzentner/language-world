    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Drop gripper around mug  3. Close gripper around mug  4. Move mug to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place gripper above mug.
    If the gripper isn't around the mug, put it around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug.
    If the gripper is near the mug and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug.
    We closed the gripper, and the mug is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the mug to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above mug and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move mug to goal.
