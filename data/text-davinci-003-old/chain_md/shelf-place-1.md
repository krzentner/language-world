    Steps:  1. Put gripper above block  2. Grab block with gripper  3. Move block to goal position  4. Drop block at goal position
    Make sure the gripper is above the block before picking it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above block, the robot should put gripper above block.
    If the gripper isn't on the block, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab block.
    Once the block is in the gripper, we can move it to the goal position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around block and the block is not located at the goal position, the robot should move block to goal position.
    Once the block is at the target location, release it.
    - When the block is located at the goal position, the robot should drop block at goal position.
