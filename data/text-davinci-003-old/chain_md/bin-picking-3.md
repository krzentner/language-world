    Steps:  1. Reach towards the cube  2. Put the gripper around the cube  3. Close the gripper to trap the cube  4. Lift the cube up  5. Move the cube to the target bin  6. Open the gripper to release the cube in the target bin
    First, reach towards the cube. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, the robot should reach towards the cube.
    If the gripper is near the cube, try to place the gripper around the cube to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    If the gripper is around the cube, close the gripper to trap the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    Now that the cube is trapped, we can lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift cube up.
    Move the cube to the target bin and open the gripper to release it in the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube to target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should open gripper to release cube in target bin.
