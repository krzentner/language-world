    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Push up or side way to pull the wrench off the peg 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    If the gripper isn't around the wrench, put it around the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around wrench.
    Now that we've grabbed the wrench, we need to pull it off the peg. We can either push up or apply a sideways force.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench, the robot should push up or slide sideways to pull wrench off peg.
