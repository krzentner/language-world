    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull up the handle 
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should pull handle up.
