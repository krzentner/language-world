    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab puck with gripper  3. Move puck to target location
    First, put the gripper directly above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Once the robot's gripper is above the puck, close the gripper to grab it and then move to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    If the puck is below the gripper, we can move the gripper with the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to target location.
