    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate back into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Now that the gripper is above the plate, we should be able to grab the plate by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around plate.
    Once the gripper is around the plate, we can start pushing it back towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate and the plate is not aligned with target, the robot should align plate to target.
    Once the plate is aligned with the target, we can slide it back.
    - When the plate is aligned with the target, the robot should slide back plate into the target.
