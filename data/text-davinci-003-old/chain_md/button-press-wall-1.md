    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the short wall 2. Move gripper left to the button 3. Push the button
    First, we need to put the gripper in front of the short wall. This is so that the short wall can provide structural support while pushing the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of short wall, the robot should put gripper in front of short wall.
    If the robot's gripper is near the button, we can start to push the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is near button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, the robot should move gripper left to the button.
    Once the robot's gripper is touching the button, just push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should push the button.
