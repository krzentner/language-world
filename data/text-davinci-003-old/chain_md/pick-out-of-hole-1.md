    First, put the gripper in front of the peg as seen from the side. The hole can make this a bit tricky, since we have to put it just right.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the peg, the robot should put the gripper in front of the peg.
    If the peg is above or below the gripper, we can try lifting it.
    - When the peg is not above or below the robot's gripper, the robot should lift up the peg.
    After the peg is lifted, try to close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not closed around peg, the robot should close the gripper around peg.
    We grabbed the peg, so we can now move it to the desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the peg, the robot should move the peg to the desired location.
