    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Line the ball up with the hoop  4. Throw the ball into the hoop
    To start, move the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put gripper above ball.
    If the ball becomes right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the ball. Because the ball is round, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the side instead of around it.
    - When ball is not right of the robot's gripper and ball is not side aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab ball.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the ball and the ball isn't lined up with the hoop, line up the ball with the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is side aligned with the ball and the ball is not horizontally aligned with hoop, the robot should align ball to hoop.
    If the ball is lined up with the hoop to the side, throw it.
    - When ball is horizontally aligned with hoop, the robot should throw ball into hoop.
