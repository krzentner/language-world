    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    Once the gripper is above the stick, we should be able to grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around stick.
    Once the gripper is around the stick, we can line up the stick with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is not aligned with thermos, the robot should align stick with thermos.
    Once the stick is lined up with the thermos, we can push the thermos with the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is aligned with thermos, the robot should push thermos with stick.
