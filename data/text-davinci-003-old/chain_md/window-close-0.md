The steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably are: 
1. Put gripper left of the window handle 
2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window 
3. Push the window closed harder 
- When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right. 
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.
