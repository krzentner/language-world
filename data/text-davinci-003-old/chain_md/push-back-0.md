Steps:  1. Put gripper behind puck  2. Push gripper into the back of the puck  3. Slide the puck backwards to the target location
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing up from behind and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't behind the gripper as seen from the back, move the gripper behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper behind the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper up to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
