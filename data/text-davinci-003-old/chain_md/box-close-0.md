Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2.Lower gripper onto box lid  3. Close grip around box lid  4. Move box lid to box side  5. Place box lid on box
    First, we need to put the gripper above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should put gripper above box lid. 
    If the box lid is below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper down to the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the box lid is below the gripper, then the robot should lower gripper onto box lid.
    Once the gripper is near the box lid with it below the gripper, we can try to close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close grip around box lid.
    We should be able to pick the box lid up now, so let's move it to the side of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move box lid to box side. 
    Now that the box lid is lined up with the box, drop it onto the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above box lid and box lid is vertically aligned with box, the robot should place box lid on box.
