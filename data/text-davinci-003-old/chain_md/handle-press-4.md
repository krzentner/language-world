The robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Push down on handle
    First, we need to get the gripper in the right position above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around handle.
    Now that we have the gripper around the handle, just push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should push down on handle.
