    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Drop gripper around the wrench  3. Position the wrench around the peg  4. Close the wrench around the peg
    First, we put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put the gripper above the wrench.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can move the gripper around it and line it up with the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the wrench.
    After the gripper is around the wrench and the peg is aligned, close the wrench around the peg to hold the peg in place.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the peg is aligned, the robot should close the wrench around the peg.
