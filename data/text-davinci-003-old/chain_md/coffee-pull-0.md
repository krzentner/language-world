    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Close gripper around mug handle  4. Pull mug to goal
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the mug handle, we should be able to grab the mug handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around mug handle, the robot should put gripper around mug handle.
    Once the gripper is around the mug handle, close the gripper to make sure we have a firm grip on the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug handle.
    Now, we can just pull the mug to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull mug to goal.
