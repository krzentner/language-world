    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Push down the gripper onto the soccer ball  3. Push the soccer ball to the target 
    First, put the gripper roughly above the soccer ball, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    -When the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around soccer ball.
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around soccer ball.
    We closed the gripper, and the soccer ball is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the soccer ball to the target. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    -When the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push soccer ball to target.
