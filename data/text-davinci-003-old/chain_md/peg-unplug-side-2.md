    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg sideways out 
    We need to put the gripper above the peg before we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg is below the gripper as seen from the front, move the gripper around the peg (but don't close the gripper yet).
    - When peg is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab peg.
    Now that the gripper is around the peg, pull the peg straight out from the side, i.e., pull the peg away from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull peg out sideways.
