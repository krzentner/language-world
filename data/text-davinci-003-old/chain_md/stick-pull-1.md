    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Push the stick towards the thermos  3. Push the stick against the thermos  4. Pull the thermos towards the goal
    First, line up the gripper above the stick, so we have something to grab to try to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    As long as the gripper is near the stick, we should be able to make contact with the Thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, the robot should push the stick towards the thermos.
    If the stick is near the Thermos we can push on it and the Thermos will start to move.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the stick against the thermos.
    Finally, we can pull the Thermos towards the goal by pushing the stick and the Thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should pull the thermos towards goal.
