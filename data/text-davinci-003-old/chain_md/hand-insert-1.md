    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move puck to target location.
