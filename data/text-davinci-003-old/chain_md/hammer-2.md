    Steps:  1. Put gripper above nail and hammer head  2. Drop gripper around hammer head  3. Swing hammer downward toward nail  4. Activate hammering action
    We need to start by placing the robot's gripper above the nail and hammer head, so that we can line the hammer up before we start swinging.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above both the nail and hammer head, the robot should put gripper above nail and hammer head.
    As long as the gripper is lined up with the nail, we can drop the gripper around the hammer head to grab the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is above both the nail and hammer head and the robot's gripper is not around the hammer head, the robot should drop gripper around hammer head.
    We can now swing the hammer downward toward the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the hammer head, the robot should swing hammer downward toward nail.
    If the hammer is close to the nail, we can activate the hammering action by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the hammer head and the hammer is close to the nail, the robot should activate hammering action.
