    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Close gripper around cube  3. Move cube to target bin  4. Let go of cube at target bin
    First, put the gripper above the cube. This way, it won't knock it over when it moves down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the gripper isn't around the cube yet, put it around the cube and make sure you close it so we can pick up the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
    We don't want to dump the cube in the bin yet, so move it above the bin and pick the cube let go when we're directly above the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move cube to target bin.
    When we're aligned with the bin, let go of the cube in the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above bin and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should let go of cube at target bin.
