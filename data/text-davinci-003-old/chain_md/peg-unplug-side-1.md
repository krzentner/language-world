Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab peg with gripper  3. Pull peg sidewards to unplug it  4. Lift peg out
    First, put the robot's gripper above the peg and adjust it so that it is just above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    Once the gripper is above the peg, move it down to the peg so that we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should grab peg.
    Now that the gripper is around the peg, we can begin to unplug it. Pull the peg sidewards and slowly out of the hole. 
    -  When the robot's gripper is around peg and the peg is still plugged into the hole, the robot should pull peg sidewards to unplug it.
    Once the peg is somewhat unplugged, lift it out of the hole so that it is completely removed.
    - When peg is unplugged and peg is still in the hole, the robot should lift peg out.
