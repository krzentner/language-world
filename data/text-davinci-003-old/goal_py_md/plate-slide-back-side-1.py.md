The steps for this task are: 
1. Put gripper slightly left of the plate 
2. Slide the plate with the gripper (right side moving) back into the target location

The code would look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper slightly left of the plate
    #  2. Slide the plate with the gripper (right side moving) back into the target location
    # If the robot's gripper is not slightly left of the plate, move it there.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not slightly left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("slightly left of the plate")
    # Once the gripper is slightly left of the plate, start sliding the plate
    # back with the right side of the plate moving.
    if check("the robot's gripper is slightly left of the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the target location", close_gripper=True)
    # If the plate is close enough to the target location, we can just push
    # it in sideways.
    if check("the plate is near the target location"): 
        robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")
