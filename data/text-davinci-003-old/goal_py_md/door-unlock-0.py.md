# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_unlock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the dial
    #  2. Drop gripper around the dial
    #  3. Turn the dial in the correct direction
    #  4. Pull open the door
    # First, put the gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the dial")
    # If the dial isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the
    # gripper above the dial.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the dial and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the dial", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the dial, turn it in the correct direction.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("in the correct direction")
    # Once the dial is turned, the door should open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the door is unlocked"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the door handle")
