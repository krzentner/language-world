To perform the task `reach-wall`, the robot will need to perform a few steps. First, the robot needs to move its gripper vertically aligned with the target wall and then move laterally until the gripper is above the target location. Once the gripper is above the target location, the robot can slowly lower the gripper to reach it.

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
# def reach_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper in front of the short wall and vertically aligned with the wall
    #  2. Move the gripper to the right or left until it is above the target location
    #  3. Move the gripper slowly downward until it reaches the target location
    # First, put the gripper in front of the short wall and vertically aligned 
    # with the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the wall")
    # Now that the gripper is in front of the wall, we can move it laterally until 
    # it is above of the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
    # Lastly, we can slowly move the gripper downward until it reaches the 
    # target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
