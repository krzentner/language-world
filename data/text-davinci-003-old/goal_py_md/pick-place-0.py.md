Then write the code:

```
# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
# def pick_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
