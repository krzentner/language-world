Here's the program to perform the task `door_lock`:

```
# door-lock: turn the dial on the door
# def door_lock(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the robot's gripper finish near the door lock
    #  2. Turn the dial of the door lock in the required direction
    # First, put the gripper near the door lock
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door lock")
    # Once the gripper is near the door lock, align it with the lock, closing it
    # around the lock.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near door lock and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with door lock", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up with the door lock, turn the dial in the
    # required direction.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door lock"):
        robot.move_gripper("right or left of the door lock")
```
