Here's the program:

```
# plate-slide-side: slide the plate sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Line the plate up with the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the plate, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the plate, we should be able to grab the
    # plate by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the plate")
    # Once the gripper is around the plate, we can just slide the plate sideways
    # into the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
