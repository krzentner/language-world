The steps for this program should be: 

1. Put gripper above the hammer
2. Grab the hammer with the gripper
3. Line the hammer up with the nail
4. Push the hammer downwards to hit the nail

The code should be:

```
# hammer: hit the nail with the hammer
# def hammer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the hammer
    #  2. Grab the hammer with the gripper
    #  3. Line the hammer up with the nail
    #  4. Push the hammer downwards to hit the nail
    # First, put the gripper above the hammer. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the hammer", close_gripper=True)
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the hammer, we should be able to grab
    # the hammer by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with hammer and the robot's gripper is not around hammer"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the hammer")
    # Now that the gripper is around the hammer, line it up with the nail.
    if check("the hammer is not horizontally aligned with the nail"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the nail")
    # Once the hammer is lined up with the nail, push it downwards to hit the nail.
    if check("the hammer is horizontally aligned with the nail"):
        robot.move_gripper("down the nail")
