Steps:
1. Line up the gripper with the button as seen from the front
2. Push the wall out of the way
3. Push down on the button

If the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, we should move it near the button to start pushing.

if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with button"):
    robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the button")

If the robot's gripper is facing the button, we should move the gripper up by pushing against the wall.

if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button and the wall is in the way"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the wall")

Once the wall is out of the way, we can push down on the button.

if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button and the wall is not in the way"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")
