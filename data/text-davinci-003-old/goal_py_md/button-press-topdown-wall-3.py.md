    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near the wall
    #  2. Put gripper around the button
    #  3. Push down the button from the top
    # First, put the gripper slightly above the wall, so the robot can place one
    # side on the wall and the other side around the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
    # Once the gripper is near the wall, we can put the gripper around
    # the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is not around the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the button, we can push it down from the top.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the button")
