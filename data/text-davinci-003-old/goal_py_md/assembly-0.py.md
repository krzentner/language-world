The robot can assemble objects by simply grasping one with the gripper and then rotating it around the other. The code would look like this:

```
# assembly: put the wrench around the peg
# def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach for the wrench
    #  2. Move the wrench above the peg
    #  3. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    #  4. Rotate the wrench around the peg
    # First, reach for the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wrench")
    # Once the gripper is near the wrench, move it above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # If the gripper isn't close to the wrench, use the gripper to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is close to the wrench and the gripper is closed, we can
    # rotate the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
