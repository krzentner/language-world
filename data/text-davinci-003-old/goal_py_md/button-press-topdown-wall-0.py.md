The steps of the algorithm are:
  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above 
  2. Put the gripper on the wall above the button 
  3. Push down on the button from the top 

First, the robot needs to get into a position where it is able to reach the button with the wall in the way. We can do this by moving the gripper to the wall above the button.

If the gripper is not near the wall, move it to the wall: 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the wall")
```

Then, if the gripper is not above the button when viewed from above, move it to the wall above the button: 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the button when viewed from above"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the button when viewed from above")
```

Finally, if the robot's gripper is above the button when viewed from above, we can push down on the button by moving the gripper near the button: 

```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the button when viewed from above"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the button")
```
