The steps are as follows:

1. Put gripper near plate
2. Slide plate back into target location

The code should look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper near plate
    #  2. Slide plate back into target location
    # First, put the gripper near the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate")
    # If the plate is not lined up with the target location, slide it back into
    # the target location.
    if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
```
