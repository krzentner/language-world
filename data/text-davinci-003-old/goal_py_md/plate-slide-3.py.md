The steps for this task are:
1. Put the gripper above the plate 
2. Slide the plate to the target location

Here's the updated code:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Slide plate to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate")
    # If the gripper is above the plate but not near it, move the gripper down
    # to the plate to slide it.
    # We can close the gripper to make sure we have a good grip on the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
