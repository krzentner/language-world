Steps:
1. Put gripper above the door dial
2. Drop gripper around the door dial
3. Turn the dial clockwise

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door dial, move the gripper above the door dial.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the door dial", close_gripper=True)
```

If the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door dial, but not near it, move the gripper down to the door dial.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door dial and the robot's gripper is not near the door dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door dial")
```

If the robot's gripper is near the door dial, close the gripper to grab the door dial.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("close around the door dial")
```

Once the gripper is closed around the door dial, turn the dial clockwise.

```
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the door dial"):
        robot.move_gripper("clockwise around the door dial")
```
