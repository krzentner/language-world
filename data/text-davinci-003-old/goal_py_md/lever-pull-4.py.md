Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the lever
2. Drop the gripper around the lever
3. Close the gripper to hold the lever
4. Rotate the lever up

If the robot's gripper is not above the lever, move it above the lever.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is not Above the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("Above the lever")
```

If the robot's gripper is above the lever, but isn't near it, move it near the lever.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not near the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the lever", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is near the lever, close the gripper around the lever.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("around the lever", close_gripper=True)
```

Once the gripper is around the lever, rotate the lever up towards the desired position.
```
if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the lever")
```
