We need to slide the puck from its current location to the designated target location in the opposite direction. 

Steps:
1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Push the gripper into the top of the puck
3. Push the puck backwards until it reaches the target location

if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
    robot.move_gripper("above the puck")

if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
    robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)

if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("towards the target location")

if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is closed"):
    robot.move_gripper("left of the target location")
