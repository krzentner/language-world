Then, write the code:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Put the gripper above the wall
    # 2. Push the wall out of the way
    # 3. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    # 4. Push down on the button from the top
    # Put the robot's gripper above the wall so that it doesn't get stuck on it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    # We can now push the wall out of the way to make space for the gripper to
    # reach the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall"):
        robot.push("wall out of way")
    # Once the wall has been pushed out of the way, we can put the gripper above
    # the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
