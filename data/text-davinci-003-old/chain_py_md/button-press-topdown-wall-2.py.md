The code is:

```
# button-press-topdown-wall: push the button down from above with a short wall in the way
# def button_press_topdown_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wall
    #  2. Lower gripper to the button
    #  3. Push down on the button from the top
    # First, we need to put the gripper above the wall so that the robot can
    # reach the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.put("gripper above wall")
    # Now that the gripper is above the wall, we can lower it to the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.drop("gripper near button")
    # Once the gripper is near the button, the robot can push down on the
    # button from the top.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button"):
        robot.push("down on button")
