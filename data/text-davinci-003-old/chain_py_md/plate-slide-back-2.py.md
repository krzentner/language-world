The final code should look like this:

```
# plate-slide-back: slide the plate back into the target location
# def plate_slide_back(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Push the plate back into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate so we can try to grab it
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # Once the gripper is above the plate, we can grab it and slide it back.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around plate")
    # Once the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it to the target
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("plate back to target location")
```
