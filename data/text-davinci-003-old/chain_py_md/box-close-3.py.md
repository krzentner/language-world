Then implement the program:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the box lid
    #  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper
    #  3. Put the box lid on the box
    #  4. Close the box lid
    # First, the robot needs to put the gripper above the box lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above box lid")
    # If the box lid is to the left of the gripper, move the gripper to the box
    # lid.
    if check("the box lid is to the left of the gripper and the gripper is not near the box lid"):
        robot.move("gripper to box lid")
    # If the gripper is near the box lid and open, try to grab it by closing the
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    # We closed the gripper, and the box lid is still near the gripper, so we
    # probably grabbed the box lid. Put the box lid on the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on the box")
    # Now that the box lid is on the box, we can try to close the lid by pushing
    # down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.push("down on the box lid")
