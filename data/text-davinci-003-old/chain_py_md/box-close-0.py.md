The program is as follows:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the box lid
    #  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper
    #  3. Move the box lid to the box
    #  4. Place the box lid on the box
    # First, put the gripper above the box lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid"):
        robot.put("gripper above box lid")
    # If the box lid becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the box lid.
    # Because the box lid is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("box lid is not left of the robot's gripper and box lid is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("box lid")
    # Once the gripper is around the box lid, move the box lid to the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the box lid"):
        robot.move("box lid to box")
    # Once the box lid is near the box, place it on the box.
    if check("box lid is near the box"):
        robot.place("box lid on the box")
