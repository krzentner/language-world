The Steps:
1. Put gripper above the stick 
2. Grab stick with the gripper
3. Position the stick in front of the thermos
4. Push the thermos to the target location

If the gripper is not above the stick, move it there:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the stick"):
    robot.put("gripper above the stick") 
```

If the stick is not gripped, grab it with the gripper:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not gripping the stick"):
    robot.grab("stick") 
```

If the stick isn't positioned in front of the thermos, line it up:

```
if check("the stick is not forward aligned with the thermos"):
    robot.align("stick to thermos") 
```

Finally, push the thermos to the target location:

```
if check("the stick is forward aligned with thermos"):
    robot.push("thermos to target")
```
