The code should be:

```
# soccer: push the soccer ball into the target location
# def soccer(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up robot's gripper above the soccer ball
    #  2. Push ball to goal
    # First, we need to move the gripper upperly above the soccer ball
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with soccer ball"):
        robot.put("gripper above ball")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up above the soccer ball, we can push it to the goal
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with soccer ball"):
        robot.push("ball to goal")
```
