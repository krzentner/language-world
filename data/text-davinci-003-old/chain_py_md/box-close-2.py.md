Here's the code:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
# def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above box lid
    #  2. Grab the box lid
    #  3. Place the box lid on the box
    # First, put the gripper above the box lid so that it can be grabbed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.place("gripper above box lid")
    # If the gripper is near the box lid, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("box lid")
    # If the gripper is holding the box lid, try to put it on the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("box lid on box")
