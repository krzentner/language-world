Steps:
  1. Put gripper above the plate
  2. Slide the plate back to the target location

If the robot's gripper is not above the plate, then move the gripper above it.

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
    robot.put("gripper above plate")
```

If the plate is not already aligned with the target location, then slide the plate back to the target.

```
if check("the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location"):
    robot.slide("plate back to the target")
```
