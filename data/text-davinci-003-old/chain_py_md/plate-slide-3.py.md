The program should read:

```
# plate-slide: slide the plate into the target location
# def plate_slide(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above plate
    #  2. Grab plate with the gripper
    #  3. Slide plate to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # If the plate is left of the gripper, grab the plate.
    if check("the plate is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    # If the gripper is near the plate, we can start to slide the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate"):
        robot.slide("plate to the goal")
```
