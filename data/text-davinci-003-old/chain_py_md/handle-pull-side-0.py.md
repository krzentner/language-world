The code for the task should be:

```
# handle-pull-side: pull up the handle from the side
# def handle_pull_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper right of the handle
    #  2. Grab the handle with the gripper
    #  3. Pull up the handle
    # First, put the gripper right of the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the handle"):
        robot.put("gripper right of handle")
    # As long as the gripper isn't around the handle, move the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("handle")
    # If the gripper is around the handle, we can probably grab it by closing the 
    # gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around handle")
    # If the gripper is grabbing the handle, try to pull the handle up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.pull("handle up")
```
