The code for the program should be:

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Push down on the handle
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up
    # all the way.
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push down on the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```
