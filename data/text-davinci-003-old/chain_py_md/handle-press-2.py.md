The program would look like this:

```
# handle-press: push down the handle
# def handle_press(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around handle
    #  3. Push down the handle
    # We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, 
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to 
    # grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle"):
        robot.drop("gripper around handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just push down on the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around handle"):
        robot.push("down on handle")
```
