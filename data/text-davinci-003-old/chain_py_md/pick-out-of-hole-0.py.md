The answer is:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole
    #  2. Drop gripper in hole
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    #  4. Lift peg out of hole
    #  5. Move peg to goal
    # First, put the gripper above the hole so we can drop the gripper into the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    # Once the gripper is above the hole we can drop it in after making sure it's
    # open.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("the gripper into the hole")
    # If the gripper is around the peg, close the gripper around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the peg")
    # Now that the peg is held in the gripper, we can lift it out of the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the peg out of the hole")
    # Finally, move the peg to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("peg at goal")
