The code would look like this:

```
# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
# def lever_pull(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the lever
    #  2. Grab the lever with the gripper
    #  3. Rotate the lever up
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the lever, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the lever"):
        robot.place("gripper above lever")
    # If the gripper isn't around the lever, put it around the lever.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around lever")
    # If the gripper is near the lever and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near lever and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around lever")
    # We closed the gripper, and the lever is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to rotate the lever up.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above lever and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
```
