The code for the `faucet-open` task would look something like this:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
# def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the faucet handle
    #  2. Grab the faucet handle
    #  3. Turn the faucet handle to the left
  
    # First, move the gripper above the faucet handle to start turning it
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the faucet handle")
        
    # If the gripper is above the faucet handle, we can try to grab the handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle"):
        robot.grab("the faucet handle")
    
    # If the gripper is near the faucet handle, we need to start turning it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle"):
        robot.turn("the faucet handle to the left")
```
