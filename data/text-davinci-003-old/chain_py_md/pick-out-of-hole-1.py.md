Here's the program:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above hole 
    #  2. Drop gripper around peg
    #  3. Close gripper around peg
    #  4. Pull peg out of hole
    #  5. Place peg at goal
    # Start by positioning the gripper above the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the hole"):
        robot.put("gripper above hole")
    # If the gripper is not around the peg, drop the gripper around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is near the peg, close the gripper around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around peg")
    # If the gripper is closed and near the peg, try to pull the peg out of the hole.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around the peg and the robot's gripper is connected to the peg"):
        robot.pull("peg out of the hole")
    # If the peg is out of the hole, place it at the goal location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the peg is out of the hole"):
        robot.place("peg at goal")
