The program should look like this:
```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Push the plate backwards
    #  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    # First, move the gripper to the left of the plate. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper to left of plate")
    # Then, grab the plate with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around plate"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    # If the plate is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can 
    # push the plate backwards.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate"):
        robot.push("plate back")
    # Then, slide the plate sideways to its target location. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is laterally aligned with plate"):
        robot.slide("plate to target")
```
