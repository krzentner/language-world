Steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Line the robot's gripper up with the edge of the wall
4. Push the wall with the robot's gripper
5. Slide puck to goal

Firstly, we need to put the gripper above the puck.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
    robot.put("the gripper above the puck")

Secondly, we need to push the gripper into the top of the puck.
if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
    robot.push("the gripper into the puck")

Thirdly, we need to line the robot's gripper up with the edge of the wall.
if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the edge of the wall"):
    robot.align("the robot's gripper to the edge of the wall")

Fourthly, we need to push the wall with the robot's gripper.
if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the edge of the wall"):
    robot.push("the wall with the robot's gripper")

Lastly, we need to slide the puck to the goal.
if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the edge of the wall and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
    robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
