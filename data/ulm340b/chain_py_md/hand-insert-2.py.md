```
# hand-insert: pick up the puck and move it to the target location
def hand_insert(robot):

    # Steps:
    #  1. Grab the puck.
    #  2. Place the puck at the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
        robot.grab("puck")
    # As long as the robot is holding the puck, move it to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is around puck"):
        robot.place("the puck at the goal")
```

We have completed the robot's tasks.
You can check out this notebook in playground mode to see if the robot performs
the task.
