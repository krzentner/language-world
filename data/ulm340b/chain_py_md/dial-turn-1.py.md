```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
def dial_turn(robot):
    # The dial is a small object so we have to be precise.
    # The gripper needs to be above the dial, and lined up with it, and around
    # it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with dial"):
        robot.place("the gripper above the dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with dial"):
        robot.place("the gripper to the left of the dial")
    if check("the dial is not in front of the robot's gripper"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.push("the dial to the right")
```
