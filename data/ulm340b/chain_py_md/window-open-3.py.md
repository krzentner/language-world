<div class="problem">
    Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.
Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")

# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")

# peg-insert-side: grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
