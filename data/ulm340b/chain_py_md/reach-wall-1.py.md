As you're writing this program, think about what your solution to this
problem will have in common with your solutions for other tasks, and try to
give the robot reusable capabilities so that when you need to write a solution
for the next task, you can just describe how it is different from the previous
tasks and reuse some of the code you wrote for the previous tasks.

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):

    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the robot above the barrier
    #  2. Rotate the robot so it is facing the target
    #  3. Move to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the barrier"):
        robot.move("gripper above the barrier")
    #if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target location"):
    #    robot.put("the robot above the target location")
    #    robot.align("the gripper towards the target location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the barrier"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
    #if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck"):
    #    robot.drop("gripper around puck")

    # We closed the gripper, and the puck is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the puck to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")
