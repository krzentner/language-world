# Description for participants

Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# peg-insert-side: grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined
    # up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with hole")

# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from
