and continue from there.
If we wanted to sweep a cube to the right, the steps might be:

* Put gripper above the cube
* Push the gripper right into the cube from above
* Slide the cube right to the target location

Here is a video of the task being done: [video](https://youtu.be/f1qWp-8eT8c)

When you are done writing your program, press "Run" and it will be tested.

After you are done, try to run `task-check` to see if your program can perform the full task.

Good luck!
