For `# Steps:`, put `3` steps.
For `Step 1`, put `Put gripper right of the plate`.
For `Step 2`, put `Grab the plate with the gripper`.
For `Step 3`, put `Slide the plate back to the target location`.

Then, write the logic for the task.
Here is what the robot can do:

* `robot.move_gripper`:
  * `"above plate"`
  * `"right of plate"`
  * `"left of plate"`
  * `"horizontally aligned with plate"`
  * `"near plate"`
* `robot.move_gripper`:
  * `"above target location"`
  * `"near target location"`
* `check`:
  * `"plate is below the robot's gripper"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is open"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is around plate"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate"`
  * `"plate is in front of the robot's gripper"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is above plate"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is right of plate"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is left of plate"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with plate"`
  * `"the robot's gripper is near plate"`
  * `"plate is near target location"`

Please explain your code step by step to make sure that I understand.
