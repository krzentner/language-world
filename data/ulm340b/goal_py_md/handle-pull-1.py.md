## Observations

Your program will have access to the following observations:
- `is the robot's gripper open` binary observation of whether the robot's gripper is open (1) or closed (0)
- `is the robot's gripper closed` binary observation of whether the robot's gripper is open (0) or closed (1)
- `is the robot's gripper horizontally aligned with handle` binary observation of whether the robot's gripper is aligned with the handle from the front (1) or not aligned with the handle (0)
- `is the robot's gripper vertically aligned with handle` binary observation of whether the robot's gripper is aligned with the handle from the side (1) or not aligned with the handle (0)
- `is handle at the bottom position` binary observation of whether the handle is fully down (1) or partially or fully up (0)
- `is handle at the top position` binary observation of whether the handle is fully up (1) or partially or fully down (0)
- `is handle fully raised` binary observation of whether the handle is fully up (1) or partially or fully down (0)
- `is handle horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper` binary observation of whether the handle is aligned with the robot's gripper from the front (1) or not aligned with the robot's gripper (0)
- `is handle in front of the robot's gripper` binary observation of whether the handle is in front of the robot's gripper (1) or not in front of the robot's gripper (0)
- `is handle left of the robot's gripper` binary observation of whether the handle is to the left of the robot's gripper (1) or not to the left of the robot's gripper (0)
- `is handle left of the robot's gripper` binary observation of whether the handle is to the left of the robot's gripper (1) or not to the left of the robot's gripper (0)
- `is handle right of the robot's gripper` binary observation of whether the handle is to the right of the robot's gripper (1) or not to the right of the robot's gripper (0)
- `is handle right of the robot's gripper` binary observation of whether the handle is to the right of the robot's gripper (1) or not to the right of the robot's gripper (0)
- `is the robot's gripper around handle` binary observation of whether the robot's gripper is
