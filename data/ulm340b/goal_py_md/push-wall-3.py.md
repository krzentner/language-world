Then write the rest of your program.
The program will be evaluated on how close the robot gets to the target location.

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from
    # above and moving the gripper.
    # If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the puck")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper
    # down to the puck to slide it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
```

# Step 2

Let's make the program simpler by getting rid of the comments.

Here's the code without comments:

```

# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the door handle", close_gripper=True)
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the door handle")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically
