# Step 0

# Put the gripper above the peg


# The robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg



# If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg
# Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.


# peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper



# As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.


# peg is not horizontally aligned with hole



# If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.


# the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole
