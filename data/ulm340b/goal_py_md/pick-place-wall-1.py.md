The solution for task `pick-place-wall` is also shown below:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Move gripper right of the wall
    #  4. Close gripper around puck
    #  5. Move gripper to the target location
    # The wall is low, so we can just move above it.
    # Start by putting the gripper mostly above the puck, so that we don't bump
    # it while trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # As long as the gripper is mostly around the puck, we can move over the
    # wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not to the right of wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that we're to the right of the wall, we can close the gripper around
    # the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the puck is right of wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck")
    # With the gripper around the puck, we can move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the puck is to the right of wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
