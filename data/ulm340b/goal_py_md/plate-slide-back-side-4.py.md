Your program should consist of a few if statements like the other tasks, such
as:

```
if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
```

The goal for the `plate-slide-back-side` task is:

```
if check("the plate is not in the target location"):
    robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the target location")
```

## Task 2: Evaluating Your Program

Write a program that evaluates whether your robot will accomplish the `plate-slide-back-side`
task in a given number of timesteps.

```
def plate_slide_back_side_complete(num_timesteps):
    # Your code here
    return True
```

This method should return True if the robot accomplishes the task (i.e. executes
the goal) within the time limit. It should return False if the robot does not.

If you call this method with the same number of timesteps that we call it with, you should pass all of the tests in test_robot.py.

```
plate_slide_back_side_complete(300)
# True
```
