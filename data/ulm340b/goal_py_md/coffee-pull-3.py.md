Then write some code to perform the task.
Try to comment your code. Comments should be lines beginning with `#`.


You will not need to change the code above to complete the rest of this task.


Please write a program to perform the last task, `coffee-pull`.
Begin with the text:

```
# coffee-pull: grab the mug and pull it to the target location
def coffee_pull(robot):
```

Then write some code to perform the task.
Try to comment your code. Comments should be lines beginning with `#`.


Now try running the following code and see what happens:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")

# drawer-close: push the drawer close
def drawer_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle
    #  2. Push the drawer closed
    # If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer
    # handle.
    # We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large
    # and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the drawer handle")
    # If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can
    # push the drawer closed.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the drawer handle")

# door-open: pull the door open
