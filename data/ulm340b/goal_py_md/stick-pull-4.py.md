    if check("the robot's gripper is below the stick"):

    # Since the stick is in the robot's gripper, we want to move it away from
    # the goal.
    if check("the thermos is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.move_gripper("away from the target location", close_gripper=True)
    # If the thermos is aligned with the stick, we can move it to the goal.
    if check("the stick is near the thermos"):
        robot.move_gripper("at the target location", close_gripper=True)
