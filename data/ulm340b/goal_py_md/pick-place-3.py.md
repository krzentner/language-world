As before, you have access to the `robot.move_gripper()` function and the `check` function.

This should be done in the same coding style as the above examples; you may copy and paste from the above examples.
The code should have the same structure and follow the same best practices as in the above examples.

If you get stuck, you may copy parts of your code from the code you wrote for `pick-place-with-reach`.
You should still try to understand the above code and the logic behind the `pick-place` task.

    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above

    # open.
