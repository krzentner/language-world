Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above drawer handle
    #  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
    #  3. Pull open the drawer
    # We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it,
    # because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to
    # grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the drawer handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just
