The solution is below. Try to fill it out first, and only look if you need to.
The answer is only for the task in this HIT, so feel free to write different
code if you want to try other things with the robot.

```
# peg-unplug-side: grab the peg and pull the it out from the side
def peg_unplug_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Line the peg up with the hole
    #  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined
    # up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # If the peg is lined up with the hole to the side, insert it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with hole")
