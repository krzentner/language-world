# ## [Task 6: coffee-button: push the button on the coffee machine]
# Write code below that tells the robot how to push the button on the coffee machine.
#
# We can see the initial state of the coffee machine here:
# <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://assets.codebreaker.shivam.org/cbt_scenes/coffee_button.html"></iframe>
#
# If you get stuck, you can also run the following commands to check your work:
# ```bash
# cbt submit  # checks the solution in this task
# cbt hint    # prints a hint for this task
# ```
#
# The robot's gripper is `0% open` at the beginning, so make sure to write
# instructions to close it and open it again.


# ## Solution
#
# Your solution should look like this:
#
# ```
# def coffee_button(robot):
#     if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
#         robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
#     if check("the robot's gripper is above button"):
#         robot.move_gripper("below button")
# ```
#
# There is no need to open the gripper afterwards, since the task will just end afterwards.
#
# We can also see an animation of our solution below:
