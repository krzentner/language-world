Hello.



Today I would like you to help me control a robot.
The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

The task `drawer-open` requires the robot to pull the drawer open.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, the robot should put gripper above drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, the robot should put gripper around drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, the robot should pull away from drawer.

The task `drawer-close` requires the robot to push the drawer close.
To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should grab drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, the robot should push drawer closed.

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should pull door open.

The task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door closed.
To push the door closed reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with door handle, the robot should push door closed.

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to push the button to the side from above.
To push the button to the side from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    - When the robot's gripper is
