    Answer:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.

The task `pick-place-wall` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a wall in the way.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a wall in the way reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Answer:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to push the short stick to the target location.
To push the short stick to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Answer:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should push the gripper into the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, the robot should push the stick to the goal.

The task `stick-push-side` requires the robot to push the long stick to the target location.
To push the long stick to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Answer:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should push the gripper into the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, the robot should push the stick to the goal.

The task `scoop` requires the robot to scoop the puck into the basin.
To scoop the puck into the basin reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Answer:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is
