  - When the robot's gripper is not near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around puck.

  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should align gripper to puck.

  - When the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should close gripper around puck.

  - When the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should align gripper with puck.

  - When the robot's gripper is not below puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around puck.
