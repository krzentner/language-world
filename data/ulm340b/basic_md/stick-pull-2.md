    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    - When the stick is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the thermos is not to the right of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull the thermos to the right.
    - When the stick is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the thermos is to the right of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull the thermos to the goal.

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location.
To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    - When the stick is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the thermos is not to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push the thermos to the left.
    - When the stick is forward aligned with the robot's gripper and the thermos is to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should push the thermos to the goal.

The task `rope-pull` requires the robot to pull the rope down and slide the thermos to the target location.
To pull the rope down and slide the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the rope, the robot should put gripper above rope.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the rope and the rope is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should grab rope.
    - When the rope is in the robot's gripper and the thermos is not to the right of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull the thermos to the right.
    - When the rope is in the robot's gripper and the thermos is to the right of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull the thermos to the goal.

The task `rope-push` requires the robot to push the rope up and slide the thermos to the target location.
