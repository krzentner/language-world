Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `drawer-open` requires the robot to pull the drawer open.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, the robot should put gripper above drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, the robot should put gripper around drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, the robot should pull away from drawer.

The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front.
To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with button, the robot should place gripper in front of button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button, the robot should push button.

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.

The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.

The task `push` requires the robot to slide the puck to the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
