    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, the robot should push the robot's gripper behind the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push gripper into puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is behind the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.

The task `pick-place-with-obstacle` requires the robot to pick up the puck and place it around the obstacle to the target location.
To pick up the puck and place it around the obstacle to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the robot's gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the robot's gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the puck at the goal.

The task `push-with-obstacle` requires the robot to slide the puck around the obstacle to the target location.

    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.

The task `push-back-with-obstacle` requires the robot to slide the puck backwards around the obstacle to the target location.
To slide the puck backwards around the obstacle to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the puck,
