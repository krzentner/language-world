The task `pick-place` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

The task `pick-place-with-gripper` requires the robot to pick up the puck with the gripper and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck with the gripper and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.

The task `peg-unplug-side` requires the robot to pull the peg out of the hole to the side.
To pull the peg out of the hole to the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should grab peg.
    - When peg is left of the robot's gripper, the
