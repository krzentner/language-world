print('Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.')

# print('The task `push` requires the robot to slide the puck to the target location.')
# print('To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is not above puck and the robot\'s gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot\'s gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot\'s gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.')

# print('The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.')
# print('To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.')

# print('The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.')
# print('To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:')
# print('    - When the window handle is right of the robot\'s gripper and the robot\'s gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.')

# print('The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.')
# print('To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:')
# print('    - When the robot\'s gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.')
# print('    - When peg is not left of the robot\'s gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot\'s gripper, the robot should grab peg.'
