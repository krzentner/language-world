    A: To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
        - When the plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should put gripper above plate.
        - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
        - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not close to plate, the robot should push gripper into plate.
        - When the robot's gripper is close to the plate and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with plate, the robot should slide plate to goal.
    B: To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
        - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, the robot should align gripper above plate.
        - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
        - When the plate is not forward aligned with robot's gripper, the robot should slide plate to goal.

The task `cup-slide-top` requires the robot to slide the cup into the target location from above.
To slide the cup into the target location from above reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    A: To slide the cup into the target location from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
        - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cup, the robot should move gripper above cup.
        - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the cup, the robot should put gripper above cup.
        - When the cup is not in front of robot's gripper, the robot should align gripper above cup.
        - When the cup is not forward aligned with robot's gripper and the cup is not right of robot's gripper, the robot should slide cup to goal.

        - When the cup is not in front of robot's gripper, the robot should slide cup to goal.

The task `regrasp-side` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
