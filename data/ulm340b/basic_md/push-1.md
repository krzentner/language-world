The task `push` requires the robot to slide the puck to the target location.
To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with puck and the robot's gripper is above the puck, the robot should place gripper near puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should grab puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with puck and the robot's gripper is near puck, the robot should push puck to goal.


The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, what steps the robot should perform?



The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window left.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window left harder.

To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?



The task `pick-place` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.
