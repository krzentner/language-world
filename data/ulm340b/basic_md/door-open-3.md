The task `peg-unstack` requires the robot to unstack the peg on top from another.
To unstack the peg on top from another reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

Possible answer:
    When the robot's gripper is not above the peg and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
    When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should grab the peg.
    When the robot's gripper is above the other peg and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the other peg, the robot should align the peg to the other peg.
    When the robot's gripper is near the other peg, the robot should put the peg on the other peg.
    When the robot's gripper is above the other peg and the robot's gripper is not open, the robot should open the gripper.
    When the other peg is horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper up.
    When the robot's gripper is far from the peg, the robot should move the gripper back to the peg.
    When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper.

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to push the button from the side.
