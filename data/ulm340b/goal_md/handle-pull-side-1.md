    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle up
    If the gripper is not above the handle, move it above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is roughly lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle

The task `handle-pull` requires the robot to pull up the handle.
To pull up the handle reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle up
    Put the gripper above the handle so that we can easily grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    If the gripper is above the handle, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle

    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle

The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button.
To push the button reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Grab the button with the gripper  3. Push the button down
    First, we want to put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
