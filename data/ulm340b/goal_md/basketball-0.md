    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Line the ball up with the hoop  4. Push the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball
    If the ball becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the ball. Because the ball is a large object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the ball is not left of the robot's gripper and the ball is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the ball and the ball isn't lined up with the hoop, line up the ball with the hoop.
    - When the ball is not horizontally aligned with the hoop and the ball is vertically aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the ball is lined up with the hoop vertically, insert it.
    - When the ball is vertically aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the ball and the ball is horizontally aligned with the hoop

The task `hook` requires the robot to lift the chain by grabbing the end of the chain, holding it up, and pulling it onto the hook.
To lift the chain by grabbing the end of the chain, holding it up, and pulling it onto the hook reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the chain  2. Grab the chain with the gripper  3. Pull the chain up toward the hook  4. Pull the chain closer to the hook  5. Close the chain around the hook
    First, put the gripper above the chain.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the chain, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the chain
    If the chain is not left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the chain.
    - When the chain is not left of the robot's gripper and the chain is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the chain
