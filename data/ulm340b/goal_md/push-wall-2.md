    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `reach-multi` requires the robot to reach towards a target location.
To reach towards a target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

The task `pick-multi` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at a target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at a target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck
