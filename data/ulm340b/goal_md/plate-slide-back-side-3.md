    Possible steps:  1. Put gripper around the plate  2. Slide the plate back
    The robot can slide the plate by grabbing the plate and moving it towards the target. If the gripper isn't around the plate, the robot should line it up so it's able to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot's gripper is around the plate, it can slide the plate by moving it in the direction of the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `plate-slide-side-side` requires the robot to slide the plate sideways into the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

The task `pick-place-side` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Slide gripper sideways around the puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, slide the gripper sideways around the puck to
