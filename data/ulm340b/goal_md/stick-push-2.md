    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab stick with the gripper  3. Push stick into the thermos  4. Move the thermos to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the stick. Because the thermos is a big object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
    When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick, drop the gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick
    If the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not horizontally aligned with the thermos, move the stick closer to the thermos.
    - When the stick is horizontally aligned with the thermos and the stick is not in front of the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the stick is aligned with the thermos, slide the thermos to the target location.
    - When the stick is in front of the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `scoop` requires the robot to scoop up the beans from the pot and move them to the plate.
To scoop up the beans from the pot and move them to the plate reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the pot  2. Move gripper down to pot  3. Close gripper on beans  4. Scoot pot and robot's gripper over to the plate
    First, put the gripper above the pot. Because the pot is a big object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with pot, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the pot
    Now that the gripper is above the pot, we should move the gripper down to pot so the gripper can scoop up beans.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with pot and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the pot
    If the gripper
