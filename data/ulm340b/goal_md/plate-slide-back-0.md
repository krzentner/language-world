    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate  3. Move the plate to the goal location
    Because this object is a plate, the robot needs to be holding it to move it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is aligned above the plate, closing the gripper can help pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the plate
    The plate is now in the robot's gripper, so we can probably move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `plate-slide-side` requires the robot to slide the plate sideways into the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
