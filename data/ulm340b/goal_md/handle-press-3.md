    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Put the gripper left of the handle  3. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper above the handle. This will get the robot gripper roughly aligned with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle
    Once the robot's gripper is aligned with the handle, put the gripper left of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not left of the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the handle
    Now that the gripper is aligned with the handle and left of it, push the handle down
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the handle and the robot's gripper is above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the handle

The task `peg-unstack` requires the robot to grab the top peg and lift it from the stack.
To grab the top peg and lift it from the stack reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper above the top peg  2. Close the gripper around the top peg  3. Lift the top peg straight up
    First, line up the gripper above the top peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the top peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the top peg
    Once the robot's gripper is above the top peg, close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the top peg and the robot's gripper is not above the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not around the top peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the top peg
    Now that the gripper is around the top peg, lift the top peg straight up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the top peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the top peg

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
