    Steps:  1. 
    First, we should put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    If the gripper is above the stick and open, we should close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is above the stick and the gripper is around the stick, we can lift the stick up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is above the stick
    As long as the gripper is around the stick, we can move it to the target location by moving the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location.
To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. 
    First, put the gripper around the stick, as seen from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is above the stick
    If the gripper is around the stick, we can push it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `thermos-pull` requires the robot to grab the handle of the thermos and pull it to the target location.
To grab the handle of the thermos and pull it to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. 
    First, put the gripper vertically aligned with the handle of the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with thermos handle, move the robot's
