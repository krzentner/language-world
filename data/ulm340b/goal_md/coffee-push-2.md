    Steps:  1. Move the robot's gripper to be above and around the mug  2. Close the gripper around the mug  3. Push the gripper down against the mug  4. Slide the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above and around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug or the robot's gripper is not around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is around the mug
    Once the robot's gripper is around the mug, try to close the gripper so that it holds the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now push the mug down against the table surface, so that it doesn't move out from under the gripper.
    - When the mug is above the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the mug is below the robot's gripper
    If we've done everything correctly, we should now be able to slide the mug to the target location.
    - When the mug is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `coffee-pull` requires the robot to grab the mug and move it to the target location.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
