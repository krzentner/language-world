    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Drop the gripper around the stick  3. Pick up the stick by closing the gripper  4. Move the stick to the thermos  5. Slide the thermos to the target location
    Because the gripper has to go around the stick, we need to first line up the gripper with the stick
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    Now, drop the gripper around the stick by moving it down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick
    Once the gripper is around the stick, close the gripper to grip the stick
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now, bring the stick to the thermos so we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the stick is near the thermos
    Finally, push the thermos to the target location
    - When the thermos is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the thermos is near the target location

The task `stick-side-push` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to push the thermos sideways to the target location.
To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos sideways to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
