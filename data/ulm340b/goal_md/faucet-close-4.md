    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the faucet handle  2. Start pushing against the faucet handle to turn faucet  3. Push the faucet closed harder
    If the the faucet handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the faucet handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the faucet handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle we can probably push the faucet closed now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the faucet handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the faucet handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the faucet handle
