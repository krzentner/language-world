    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Drop gripper around the peg  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Put gripper at the side of the hole  5. Insert peg into hole
    First, put the gripper roughly above the peg, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the side of the hole

The task `peg-unstack` requires the robot to grab the top peg and move it to the target location.

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the top peg  2. Drop gripper around the top peg  3. Close gripper around the top peg  4. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the top peg, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the top peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the top peg
    If the gripper isn't around the top peg, put it around the top peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the top peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the top peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the top peg and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the top peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
