    To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the the window handle is left of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be behind the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the window handle
