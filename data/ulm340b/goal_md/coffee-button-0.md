    Steps:  1. Align the gripper above the button.  2. Drop the gripper around the button.  3. Close the gripper around the button.
    The first step is to align the robot's gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button.
    The second step is to drop the robot's gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the button.
    The third step is to close the gripper around the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open.

The task `peg-unstack` requires the robot to push the top peg off the stack of two pegs.
To push the top peg off the stack of two pegs reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Place the gripper on top of the two pegs.  2. Push the top peg off the stack.
    The first step is to place the robot's gripper on top of the two pegs.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the top peg.
    The second step is to push the top peg off the stack.
    - When the top peg is not far from the stack, move the robot's gripper until the top peg is far from the stack.

The task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door closed.
To push the door closed reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle.
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle.
