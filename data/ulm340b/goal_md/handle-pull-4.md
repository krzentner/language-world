    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Move gripper down to around the handle  3. Pull the handle up
    We need to put the gripper above the handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle

The task `handle-pull-side` requires the robot to pull up the handle.
To pull up the handle reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
