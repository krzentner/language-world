    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the door handle  2. Grab the door handle with the gripper  3. Twist the door handle
    First, put the gripper above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle and not forward aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle
    Now, just turn the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the door handle

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to press the button from the side.
To press the button from the side reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper in front of the button  2. Line up the gripper  3. Push the button
    First, we need to make the gripper be mostly in front of the button so that the robot can line the gripper up vertically with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the button
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the button and the robot's gripper is not right of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the button and the robot's gripper is not left of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the button, we can just push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the button and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
