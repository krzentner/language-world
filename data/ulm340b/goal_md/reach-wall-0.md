    Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.



The task `drawer-open` requires the robot to pull the drawer open.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Pull open the drawer
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle

The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
