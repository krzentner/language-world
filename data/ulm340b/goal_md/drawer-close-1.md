    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Push the drawer close
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just push the drawer close.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle

The task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door close.
To push the door close reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Push the door close
    First, put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of door handle

The task `pick-place-side` requires the robot to pick up the peg and hold it near the hole, sideways.
To pick up the peg and hold it near the hole, sideways, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
