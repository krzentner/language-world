    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Start pushing puck towards the goal  4. Push puck harder
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is closed around the puck, we can probably start pushing towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with puck
    If the robot's gripper is still around the puck, push harder towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around puck and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with puck

The task `insert-peg` requires the robot to drop the peg into the hole.
To drop the peg into the hole reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Line up gripper with the hole from above  2. Line up gripper with the hole from the side  3. Line up gripper with the hole from above  4. Drop gripper around the hole  5. Open gripper to release the peg
    First, put the gripper roughly above the hole, so that we don't bump it while trying to drop the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with hole and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is roughly above the hole, line up the gripper with the hole from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with hole
    As long as the gripper is not forward aligned with the hole, drop the gripper down around the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around hole
    If the gripper
