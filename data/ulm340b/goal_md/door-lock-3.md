    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the door dial  2. Grab the door dial  3. Turn the door dial
    First, put the gripper above the door dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the door dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the door dial
    If the gripper isn't around the door dial, put it around the door dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around door dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with door dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the door dial and closed, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above door dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door dial
