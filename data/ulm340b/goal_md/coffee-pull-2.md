    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull the cup to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug's handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above handle
    If the robot's gripper is above handle, move the gripper down around handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around handle
    If the gripper is around handle, we can pull the mug towards the goal
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near target location

The task `coffee-push` requires the robot to grab the mug and push it to the target location.

The task `hook-pull` requires the robot to pull the hook off of the peg.
To pull the hook off of the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the hook  2. Grip the hook  3. Pull the hook off the peg
    First, put the gripper roughly in front of the hook.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the hook and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the hook, move the robot's gripper until the robot
