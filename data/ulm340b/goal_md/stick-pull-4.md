(HINT: it can be done with two steps!)
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick and move gripper down around the stick. 2. Move the stick down, pushing the thermos to the target location.
    If the robot's gripper is not above the stick and vertically aligned with the stick, move the gripper until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
    If the gripper is aligned with the stick but not near it, move the gripper down to the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not near stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the stick and around it, the gripper should be able to push the stick down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location.
To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform? (HINT: it can be done with two steps!)
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick and move gripper down around the stick. 2. Move the stick forward, pushing the thermos to the target location.
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the gripper until it is.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
    If the gripper is aligned with the stick but not near it, move the gripper down to the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not near stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the stick and around it, the gripper should be able to push the stick forward.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `pick-place-side` requires the robot to pick up the peg and hold it sideways
