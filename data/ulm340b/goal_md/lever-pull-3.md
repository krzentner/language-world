    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Push lever upward
    First, put the gripper mostly above the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the lever
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is above the lever, we can rotate the lever upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is not around the lever

The task `lever-push` requires the robot to rotate the lever down.
To rotate the lever down reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

The task `drawer-close` requires the robot to push the drawer closed.
To push the drawer closed reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Push the drawer closed
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
    If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot'
