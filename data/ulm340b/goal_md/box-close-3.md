    Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the box lid 2. Put the gripper around the box lid 3. Move the box lid to the box 4. Place the box lid on the box
    The box lid is big enough that we can just place the gripper directly above it and close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the box lid
    Now that the gripper is above the box lid, close the gripper around the box lid
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the box lid and the robot's gripper is not around the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed and around the box lid
    Now that the robot is holding the box lid, we can move it directly to the box and place it on top.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and around the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the box

The task `peg-insert-topdown` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from above.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from above reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the peg 2. Grab the peg with the gripper 3. Line the peg up with the hole 4. Slide the peg down into the hole
    We need to start by putting the gripper above the peg, so that the gripper is in a good spot to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    Now that the gripper is above the peg, we can close the gripper on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
    Now that the robot is holding the peg, we can align it with the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not vertically aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is vertically aligned with the hole
    Now that the peg is aligned with the hole, we can slide the peg down into the hole.
    - When the peg is vertically aligned with the hole,
