    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the faucet handle  2. Grip the faucet handle  3. Turn the faucet right  4. Turn the faucet harder
    First, put the robot's gripper above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, we can probably turn it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is above the faucet handle and closed, we can try to turn the faucet by moving the robot's gripper to the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the faucet handle and the faucet handle is not right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle
    - When the faucet handle is right of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the faucet handle
    If the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle, then we can just move the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle

The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the
