The following steps would help:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper vertically aligned with the handle  2. Press down on the handle
    First, put the gripper vertically aligned with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle
    Now that the gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, press down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle

The task `push-side` requires the robot to slide the puck sideways to the target location.
To slide the puck sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `lever-side` requires the robot to push down the lever.
To push down the lever reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
The following steps would help:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever  2. Press down on the lever
    First, put the gripper around the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's
