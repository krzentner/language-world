    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Drop gripper around the box lid  3. Close gripper around the box lid  4. Move gripper down near the box
    First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the box lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box

The task `reach-to-target-with-obstacle` requires the robot to reach to the target location without touching the obstacle.
To reach to the target location without touching the obstacle reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Move gripper to the target location without touching the obstacle
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location without touching the obstacle
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the reach target and the robot's gripper is not touching the obstacle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

The task `lift` requires the robot to lift the block and put it on the goal.
To lift the block and put it on the goal reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Drop gripper around the block  3. Close gripper around the block  4. Move the block to the goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot'
