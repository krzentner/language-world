    Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near cube

    Steps:  1. Reach towards cube  2. Scoop the cube into the gripper  3. Move the cube to the target location
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not near cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near cube
    Once we are near the cube we should scoop the cube into the gripper
    - When the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
    Now that the gripper is around the cube, just move the cube to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location

The task `hook-into` requires the robot to grab the peg and
