    We need to line up above the button so we don't bump into the coffee machine when pressing the button. If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is closed
    When the gripper is lined up with the button, push down on it from above. If the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near button and the robot's gripper is closed

The task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door closed.
To push the door closed reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Push closed the door
    First, put the gripper above door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle
    If the gripper is almost aligned with the door, put the gripper down around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    Now push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle

The task `microwave-door` requires the robot to open the microwave door.
To open the microwave door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the microwave door handle  2. Drop gripper around microwave door handle  3. Open microwave door
    First, put the gripper above the microwave door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with microwave door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the microwave door handle
    Then drop the gripper around the microwave door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with microwave door handle and the robot's gripper is not around microwave door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the microwave door handle
    Then open the microwave door.
    - When the robot's gripper is around microwave door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot
