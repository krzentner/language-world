    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Drop gripper around the puck  3. Push the puck sideways to the target
    First, put the gripper above the puck so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around puck
    Once the gripper is around the puck, we can just push it to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near puck

The task `push-neg` requires the robot to push the puck down from the side.
To push the puck down from the side reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Line gripper up with puck  3. Push the puck down
    Put the robot's gripper above puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is not forward aligned with puck, line up the gripper with the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with puck
    Once the gripper is lined up with the puck, push the puck down from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near puck

The task `peg-insert-front` requires the robot to push the peg down into the hole from the front.
To push the peg down into the hole from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Line gripper up with the peg  3. Push the peg down into the hole
    Put the robot's gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    Once the robot's gripper is above the peg, line up the
