    Steps:  1. Push gripper into plate from the side  2. Slide plate back into the goal  3. Let go of the plate
    First, put the robot's gripper near the plate and push it against it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near plate
    If the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the gripper as seen from the front, slide the plate back to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with plate
    When the plate is mostly at the goal, let go of the plate.
    - When plate is near target location and plate is vertically aligned with plate goal, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near plate

The task `plate-slide-forward` requires the robot to slide the plate forward into the target location.
To slide the plate forward into the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
