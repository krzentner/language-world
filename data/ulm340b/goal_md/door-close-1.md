The robot is going to perform a task. It can use the following actions:
    * move the robot's gripper, by an amount between 0 and 1. Positive numbers move the robot's gripper to the right.
    * rotate the robot's gripper, by an amount between -1 and 1. Positive numbers rotate the robot's gripper counterclockwise.

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is
