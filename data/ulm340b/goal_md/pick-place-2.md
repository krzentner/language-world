Answer:  Pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Close gripper around puck  3. Move gripper to target
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck
    If the puck is held in the gripper we can lift it by just moving it. If the gripper is already at the target location, just keep moving the gripper up to keep holding the puck there.
    - When the puck is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is above the target location

The task `pick-place-reach` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
