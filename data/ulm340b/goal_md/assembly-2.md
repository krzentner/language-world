    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle of the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Line the wrench up with the peg  4. Push the wrench into the peg
    We need to put the gripper above the wrench so that we can grab it and wrap it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the wrench handle
    If the wrench becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the wrench. Because the wrench is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the wrench handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the wrench handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench handle
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the wrench and the wrench isn't lined up with the peg, line up the wrench with the peg.
    - When the wrench handle is horizontally aligned with the peg handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wrench handle
    If the wrench is lined up with the peg, push it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench handle and the wrench handle is not horizontally aligned with the peg handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg handle

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to push the button from the side.
To push the button from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Push gripper into button from side
    Because the button is small, and we're not pushing it from directly above, put the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    Now, just push the gripper down from the side into the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

The task `lever-pull` requires the robot to grab the lever and pull it down.
To grab the lever and pull it down reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever
