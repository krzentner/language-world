    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Push the button down
    Because this is "side", we need to line up the gripper from the front to the side of the button. Line up the robot's gripper from the front to the side of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button

The task `reach-behind-wall` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to push the button.
To push the button reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Push the button down
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
