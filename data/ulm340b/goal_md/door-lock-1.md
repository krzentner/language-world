The task `drawer-close` requires the robot to push the drawer close.
To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Push the drawer closed
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
    If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle

The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the reach target

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from
