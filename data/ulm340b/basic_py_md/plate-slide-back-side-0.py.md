The task requires the following conditions to be met in order to be successful:

 - The plate is at the target location, 
 - The robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate.
 - The robot's gripper is not near the plate,
 - The robot's gripper is not around the plate.
 - The plate is below the robot's gripper.
 - The robot's gripper is left of the plate.

It will be useful to make note of some things that I know how to check:

```
# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")

# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.pull("door open")

# drawer-close: push the drawer close
def drawer_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")

# peg-insert-side: grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
