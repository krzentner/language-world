If you are interested in what commands the robot understands,
here is how the other programs are using them:
```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")

# peg-insert-side: grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.put("gripper above peg")
    if check("peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.align("peg to hole")
    if check("peg is horizontally aligned with hole"):
        robot.insert("peg into hole")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")

# window-open: slide the window open to the left
def window_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")

# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
def pick_place(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if
