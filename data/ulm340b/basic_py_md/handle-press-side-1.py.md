Then, write some code to make the robot push down the handle from the side.

      Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.reach("to goal")

# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")

# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.pull("door open")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")
