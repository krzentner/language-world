and continue with the rest of your code. The robot should slide the puck backwards toward the target location. It is fine to touch the puck with the gripper. The `push_back` program should be very similar to the `push` program, but with the direction of motion flipped.

In addition to the methods used in the programs above, the robot can also do: `if check(robot.is_near_to(x)):\n robot.slide(to goal)`, where `x` is one of `--gripper` (the robot's gripper), `--peg`, `--door_handle`, `--button`, `--hole`, `--window_handle`, `--drawer_handle`, `--drawer`, `--puck`, `--reach_target`.
