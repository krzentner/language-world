and follow it by code that solves the task in the same style. Use if-then-statements, a "robot.put" statement, and a "robot.pull" statement.

I will evaluate your program based on whether you used a "robot.put" statement, a "robot.pull" statement, and whether you made appropriate if-then-statements.
