Hello. Today I would like you to write a program to help me control a robot.

The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's an example program:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
def window_close(robot):
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to left of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")

# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("gripper above button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.push("down on button")

# peg-insert-side: grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with
