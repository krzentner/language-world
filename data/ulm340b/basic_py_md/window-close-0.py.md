You can use any of the following methods:

- `robot.place(string)`
- `robot.put(string)`
- `robot.push(string)`
- `robot.pull(string)`
- `robot.pull(string)`
- `robot.reach(string)`
- `robot.slide(string)`
- `robot.close(string)`
- `robot.open(string)`
- `robot.insert(string)`
- `robot.grab(string)`
- `robot.align(string)`

Please use the following conditions to help guide your code:

- "the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"
- "the robot's gripper is near the window handle"
- "the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle"
- "the robot's gripper is not in front of the window handle"
- "the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"
- "the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle"

You can check these conditions with:

```
if check(condition_string):
    ...
```

Your program should do the following things in this order:

- check that the gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle
- move the gripper right to the handle
- pull the window until closed

If you want to verify that your code is correct, you can run `python simulator.py`, which will show you what the robot does given the code that you wrote.
