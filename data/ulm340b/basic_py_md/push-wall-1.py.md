and add a number of `if` statements to call the robot's `push`, `slide`, `open`, `close`, `drop`, `grab`, `align`, `insert`, `put`, or `pull` functions to complete the task. The robot's `check` function returns `True` or `False`. The robot can only call `check` once per program.

```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    robot.check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```

## 2 - Robot Programming Tasks

Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.pull("door open")

# drawer-open: pull the drawer open
def drawer_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")

# drawer-close: push the
