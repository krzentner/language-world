    Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

    Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

    '''
    # pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
    def pick_place(robot):
        if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
            robot.place("gripper above puck")
        if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
            robot.drop("gripper around puck")
        if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
            robot.close("gripper around puck")
        if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
            robot.place("puck at goal")

    # stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
    def stick_pull(robot):
        if check("the robot's gripper is not above stick"):
            robot.move("gripper above stick")
        if check("the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
            robot.drop("gripper around stick")
        if check("the robot's gripper is near stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
            robot.close("gripper around stick")
        if check("the robot's gripper is above stick and the robot's gripper is closed"):
            robot.move("the stick behind the thermos")
        if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the thermos"):
            robot.pull("the thermos to the goal")
        if check("the thermos is below the robot's gripper"):

        if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the stick"):

    Please complete the second function `stick_pull`.
