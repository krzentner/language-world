    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
    If the handle becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the handle. Because the handle is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the handle.
    As long as the gripper is lined up with the handle from in front, we can push down the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle, the robot should push down the handle.
