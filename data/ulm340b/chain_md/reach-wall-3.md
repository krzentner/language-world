    Steps:  1. Move to wall  2. Go past wall  3. Move to target
    The first step is to move the gripper directly to the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move to wall.
    Once the robot's gripper is close enough to the wall, the gripper should move closer to the target location, past the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall, the robot should go past wall.
    The last step is to make the gripper move to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should move to goal.

The task `reach-wall-high` requires the robot to reach to the target location with a tall wall in the way.
To reach to the target location with a tall wall in the way reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Move to wall  2. Go up past wall  3. Move to target
    The first step is to move the gripper directly to the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move to wall.
    Once the robot's gripper is close enough to the wall, the gripper should move closer to the target location, past the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall, the robot should go up past wall.
    The last step is to make the gripper move to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should move to goal.

The task `reach-wall-long` requires the robot to reach to the target location with a long wall in the way.
To reach to the target location with a long wall in the way reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Move to wall  2. Move down the wall  3. Move to target
    The first step is to move the gripper directly to the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move to wall.
    Once the robot's gripper is close enough to the wall, the gripper should move closer to the target location, down the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near wall, the robot should move down the wall.
    The last step is to make the gripper move to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should move to goal.
