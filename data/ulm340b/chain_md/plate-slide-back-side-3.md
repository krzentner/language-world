### Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

### The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.





















### To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:





















### Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top






















###    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.






























###    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.













































###    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.















































###    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button
