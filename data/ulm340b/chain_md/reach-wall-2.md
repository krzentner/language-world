The task `drawer-open` requires the robot to pull the drawer open.
To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Pull open the drawer
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, the robot should put gripper above drawer handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle, the robot should put gripper around drawer handle.
    Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, we can just pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around drawer handle, the robot should pull away from drawer.

The task `window-open` requires the robot to slide the window open to the left.
To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window left.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window left harder.
