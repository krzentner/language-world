    We need to put the robot's gripper to the left of the button to push it right from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is not to the right of the button, the robot should move gripper to the right of button.
    Once the robot's gripper is to the right of the button, we can push right against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the right of the button, the robot should push right against button.
