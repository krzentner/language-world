    First, put the gripper above the mug handle, as seen from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle of the mug, the robot should put gripper above handle of mug.

    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is not around handle of mug, the robot should grab handle of mug.
