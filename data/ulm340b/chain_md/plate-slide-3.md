    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.

    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around plate.

    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around plate.

    We closed the gripper, and the plate is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the plate to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above plate and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should slide plate to goal.

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to slide the stick into the target location.
To slide the stick into the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
