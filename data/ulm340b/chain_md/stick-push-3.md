To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line the stick up with the thermos  4. Push the stick towards the thermos
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the stick is below the gripper as seen from the side, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the stick is not below the robot's gripper and the stick is in front of the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the stick, we can align the stick with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the thermos is left of the stick, the robot should align stick with thermos.
    Once the stick is lined up with the thermos, we can push the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the thermos, the robot should push the stick towards the thermos.

The task `stick-insert` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to slide the puck into the goal.
To grab the stick and use it to slide the puck into the goal reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the stick becomes right of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the stick. Because the stick is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When stick is not right of the robot's gripper and stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab stick.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the stick and the stick isn't lined up with the puck, line up the stick with the puck.
