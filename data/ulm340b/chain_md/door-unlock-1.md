    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial with gripper
    First, we should put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    If the gripper is around the dial, then turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial and the dial has not turned clockwise, the robot should turn dial.

The task `drawer-close` requires the robot to push the drawer close.
To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Push the drawer closed
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should grab drawer handle.
    If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, the robot should push drawer closed.

The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not
