    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Insert the puck into the slot
    First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    If the robot's gripper is aligned with the slot, we're probably close enough that we can just slide the puck the rest of the way into the slot by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with slot and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should insert puck into slot.

The task `pick-place-side` requires the robot to grab the puck and move it sideways to the target location.
To grab the puck and move it sideways to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Line the puck up with the target location  4. Insert the puck sideways into the target location
