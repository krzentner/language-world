    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Drop gripper around wrench  3. Pull wrench off peg
    We need to put the gripper above the wrench, so that we can close the gripper without hitting the peg first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can drop it around the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around wrench.
    The robot's gripper is around the wrench, and below the peg, so pull the wrench out by pulling away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench and the robot's gripper is below peg, the robot should pull wrench away from peg.

The task `pull-in-front` requires the robot to pull the puck towards itself.
To pull the puck towards itself reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Pull puck towards itself
    First, put the gripper roughly in front of the puck, so that we can close the gripper around the puck without bumping into the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with puck, the robot should put gripper in front of puck.
    If the gripper is forward aligned with the puck, and open, the robot should drop the gripper down around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck in front, we can pull the puck towards itself.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull puck towards itself.

The task `turn-switch` requires the robot to rotate the knob clockwise.
To rotate the knob clockwise reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above knob  2. Drop gripper around knob  3. Twist knob clockwise
    First, put the gripper above the knob so that we can close the gripper down around the knob.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with knob, the robot should put gripper above knob.
    As long as the gripper is above the knob, and open, close the gripper around the knob.
    - When the
