    We need to put the gripper above the stick before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the stick, we should be able to grab the stick by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick, the robot should put gripper around stick.
    As long the gripper is still around the stick, we can pull the thermos closer to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is not near reach target, the robot should pull thermos.
    If the thermos is close to the target, the stick will start to be behind the gripper. We can just stop pulling.
    - When the robot's gripper is around stick and the stick is near thermos goal, the robot should be still.

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location.
To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

    If the thermos is close to the target, the stick will start to be in front of the gripper. We can just stop pushing.
