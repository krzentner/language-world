    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Lift gripper above wall  5. Move puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    If the gripper isn't above the wall, lift it above the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the gripper above the wall.
    The gripper is closed, so maybe we grabbed the puck, and it's above the wall, so maybe we can move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place puck at goal.

The task `pick-place-shelf` requires the robot to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a narrow shelf in the way.
To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a narrow shelf in the way reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
