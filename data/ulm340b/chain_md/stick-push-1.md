    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Close gripper around stick  4. Push thermos to goal using stick
    First, put the gripper above the stick to make it easier to grab.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above stick, the robot should place gripper above stick.
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around stick.
    If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around stick.
    If the robot is holding the stick and the thermos is in front of the gripper, we can push it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding stick and the robot's gripper is near thermos, the robot should push thermos to goal using stick.

The task `push-regrasp` requires the robot to grab the puck, slide it to the target location, let it go, and return to its start position.
To grab the puck, slide it to the target location, let it go, and return to its start position reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Slide puck to goal  5. Put puck at goal  6. Return gripper to start position
    First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
    The robot has the puck and is above the puck, so it can slide it to the goal.
