    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of plate  2. Slide plate left  3. Slide plate to the goal
    This is a flat object, so we should line the gripper up next to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the plate, the robot should move the gripper right of plate.
    If the robot's gripper is right of the plate, we can probably start to slide it by moving the gripper to the left.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of plate, the robot should slide plate left.
    If the gripper is now mostly near the plate, we can probably start to slide the plate into the goal by moving the gripper to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate, the robot should slide plate to goal.

The task `door-close` requires the robot to pull the door shut.
To pull the door shut reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull door closed
    The robot's gripper needs to be above the door handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    If the robot's gripper is above the door handle, the robot should drop its gripper down to the door handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    If the robot's gripper is around the door handle, the robot can probably close the door by pulling the door handle towards the robot.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, the robot should pull door closed.

The task `door-open` requires the robot to pull the door open.
To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    The robot's gripper needs to be above the door handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    If the robot's gripper is above the door handle, the robot should drop its gripper down to the door handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle and the
