    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck to goal  4. Push gripper away from puck  5. Reach to goal
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
    When the gripper is at the target location, open the gripper to drop the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is at reach goal and the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should push the gripper away from puck.

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to press the button from the side.
To press the button from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Push gripper into top of button  3. Push button to side
    The robot can push the button by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the button isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
    If the gripper is aligned with the button but not near it, move the gripper down to the button to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not near button, the robot should push the gripper into the button.
    If the gripper is near the button, we've probably trapped the button and can slide it.
