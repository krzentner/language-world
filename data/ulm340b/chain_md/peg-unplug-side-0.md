    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out to the side
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    If the peg is still in the hole, slide it out.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg, the robot should pull peg out of hole.

The task `peg-insert-vertical` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from above.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from above reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

    - When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
    If the gripper is still around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the hole, line up the peg with the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not vertically aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
    If the peg is lined up with the hole, lower it into the hole.
    - When peg is vertically aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.

The task `peg-unplug-vertical` requires the robot to grab the peg and pull the it out from above.
