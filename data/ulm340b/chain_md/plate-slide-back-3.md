    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Put the gripper near the plate  3. Slide the plate back to the goal 
    First, put the gripper above the plate. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    Now, the robot should put the gripper near the plate so it can slide the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate, the robot should put the gripper near the plate.
    Now the gripper is above the plate and near it, the robot should slide the plate back to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should slide the plate back to the goal.

The task `plate-slide-side` requires the robot to slide the plate sideways into the target location.
To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
