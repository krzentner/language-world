The following instructions have been provided:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the nail  2. Start pushing against the nail to drive it in
    First, put the gripper above the nail, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place gripper above nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is above nail and the robot's gripper is not near nail, the robot should hammer down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near nail and the robot's gripper is above nail, the robot should hammer down harder.
