To grab the wrench and pull it off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench  2. Drop gripper around wrench  3. Close gripper around wrench  4. Pull wrench towards goal
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    As long as the gripper is lined up vertically, closing it should make it grab the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around wrench.
    If the robot's gripper is above the wrench, the robot should close gripper around wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around wrench.
    If the robot's gripper is above the wrench, the robot should pull wrench towards goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull wrench towards goal.

The task `button-press-topdown-side` requires the robot to push the button down from above from the side.
To push the button down from above from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper from above from the side  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.

The task `peg-unstack` requires the robot to pull the peg off the stack.
To pull the peg off the stack reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
To pull the peg off the stack reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above top peg  2. Drop gripper around top peg  3. Close gripper around top peg  4. Pull peg away from stack
    First, put the gripper above the top peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above top peg, the robot should put gripper above top peg.
