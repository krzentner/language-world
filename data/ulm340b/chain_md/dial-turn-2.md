    Steps:  1. Place gripper above dial  2. Turn gripper around dial  3. Turn the dial
    The dial is at an odd angle, so we should line up the gripper from above before grabbing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
    Once the gripper is lined up, we can grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around dial, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    Once the gripper is around the dial, we can start turning the dial by pushing or pulling on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial, the robot should turn the dial.

The task `dial-turn-clockwise` requires the robot to turn the dial clockwise.
To turn the dial clockwise reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

The task `peg-unstack` requires the robot to remove the top object from a stack of pegs.
To remove the top object from a stack of pegs reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Place gripper around top peg  2. Lift top peg away
    We're pulling the peg straight up. The gripper is oriented so that we can just move it down around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the top peg, the robot should put gripper around top peg.
    Once the gripper is around the peg, lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the top peg and the robot's gripper is below the top peg, the robot should lift top peg.

The task `button-press-side` requires the robot to push the button sideways.
