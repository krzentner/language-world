    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lever  2. Line up gripper with lever, making sure to grab it  3. Lift up lever
    First, put the gripper above lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, the robot should put gripper above lever.
    If the lever is lined up with the gripper, the robot has the right angle to push the lever.
    - When lever is vertically aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near lever, the robot should align lever with gripper.
    Once the gripper is near the lever, we can lift up the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is near lever, the robot should lift lever up.

The task `lever-push` requires the robot to rotate the lever down.
To rotate the lever down reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper below lever  2. Line up gripper with lever, making sure to grab it  3. Push lever down
    First, put the gripper below lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with lever, the robot should put gripper below lever.
    If the lever is lined up with the gripper, the robot has the right angle to push the lever.
    - When lever is vertically aligned with the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near lever, the robot should align lever with gripper.
    Once the gripper is near the lever, we can push down on the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is near lever, the robot should push lever down.

The task `door-close` requires the robot to push the door closed.
To push the door closed reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Push door closed
    First, put the gripper above door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with door handle, it's being pushed closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle
