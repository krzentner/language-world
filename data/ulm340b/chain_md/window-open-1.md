    Steps:  1. Put gripper above window handle  2. Start pulling the window open  3. Pull the window open harder
    If the the window handle is left of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pulling
    - When the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper above window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should pull the window handle left.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, pull harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should pull the window harder.
