    1. Put gripper above the wrench
    2. Put gripper around the wrench
    3. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    4. Move the wrench to above the peg
    5. Move the wrench to around the peg
    6. Drop the wrench on the peg
    7. Move the wrench away from the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    When the gripper is lined up with the wrench from above, put it down on the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with wrench and the robot's gripper is not around wrench, the robot should grab wrench.
    Now that we're holding the wrench, move it to above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with peg, the robot should move wrench to above peg.
    Line up the wrench to put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with peg, the robot should line up wrench with peg.
    The wrench is almost around the peg, so now we can just drop the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with peg, the robot should drop wrench on peg.
    Because the wrench is now wrapped around the peg, we can just move the wrench away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with peg and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with peg, the robot should move wrench away from peg.

The task `peg-insert-top` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the top.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the top reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    1. Put gripper above the peg
