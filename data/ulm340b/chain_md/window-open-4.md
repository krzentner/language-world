    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pulling the window handle to open the window
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pulling it
    - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should pull window left.

TEMPLATE_EXPLANATION_WITH_QUESTION = """Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.


The task `reach` requires the robot to reach to the target location.
To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Reach towards the target
    We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's gripper directly to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should reach to goal.

The task `button-press-topdown` requires the robot to push the button down from above.
To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Push down on the button from the top
    Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above. Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.

The task `peg-insert-side` requires the robot to grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side.
To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Line the peg up with the hole  4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
