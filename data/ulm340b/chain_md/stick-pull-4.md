(Hint: put gripper above stick).
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Close gripper around stick  4. Pull stick towards thermos  5. Push thermos to the goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place gripper above stick.
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around stick.
    If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around stick.
    We closed the gripper, and the stick is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to pull the stick towards the thermos, and then the thermos to the goal. If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    - When the robot's gripper is above stick and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull stick towards thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is above stick and the thermos is below the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push thermos to the goal.

The task `stick-push` requires the robot to grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location.
To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform? (Hint: put gripper above stick).
