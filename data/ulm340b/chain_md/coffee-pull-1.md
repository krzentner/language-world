    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Put gripper around the mug  3. Pull the mug to the target location
    First, we'll line up the robot's gripper above the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with mug, the robot should put gripper above mug.
    Then, we'll put the robot's gripper around the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with mug and the robot's gripper is not around mug, the robot should put gripper around mug.
    Finally, we'll move the mug to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug, the robot should pull mug to goal.

The task `coffee-push` requires the robot to grab the mug and push it to the target location.
To grab the mug and push it to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

The task `coffee-hook` requires the robot to grab the mug by hooking it with the gripper and push it to the target location.
To grab the mug by hooking it with the gripper and push it to the target location reliably, what steps the robot should perform?
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Put gripper near the handle  3. Hook the handle  4. Pull the mug to the target location
    First, we'll line up the robot's gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Then, we'll put the robot's gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with mug handle and the robot's gripper is not near mug handle
