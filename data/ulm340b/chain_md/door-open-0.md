Steps:  1. Put gripper above door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    We need to put the gripper above the door handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the door handle, we should be able to grab the door handle by moving the gripper down around it.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just pull the door open.
- When the robot's gripper is around door handle, the robot should pull away from door.

Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the drawer).
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should grab door handle.
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the door closed.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with door handle, the robot should push door closed.

The task `peg-unstack-side` requires the robot to slide the peg to the side of the stack of pegs.
To slide the peg to the side of the stack of pegs reliably, what steps the robot should perform?

Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Slide the peg sideways out of the stack of pegs
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the peg and the peg isn't lined up with the stack of pegs, line up the peg with the stack of pegs.
- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with stack of pegs, the robot
