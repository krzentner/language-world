    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Put gripper around cube  3. Move cube to goal
    First, put the gripper above the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
    If the gripper is not around the cube, we need to put the gripper around the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not around cube, the robot should put gripper around cube.
    If the gripper is around the cube, we can move the cube to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around cube, the robot should move cube to goal.


The task `lever-pull-side` requires the robot to pull the lever down.
To pull the lever down reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever  2. Pull down on the lever
    First, put the gripper around the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever, the robot should put gripper around lever.
    Now that the gripper is around the lever, pull down on the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, the robot should pull lever down.

The task `drawer-close-topdown` requires the robot to push the drawer close.
To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Push the drawer closed
    We need to put the gripper above the drawer handle before we can grab it, because of the angle of the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above drawer handle, the robot should put gripper above drawer handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the drawer handle by moving the gripper down around
