Hello. Today I would like you to help me control a robot. The robot has a single gripper that it can use to grab small objects.

Here's some code that demonstrates how the robot can do a variety of tasks:

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
def window_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper right of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window
    #  3. Push the window open harder
    # If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle,
    # we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window open now by moving the gripper left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the window handle")

# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal
    # The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from
    # above and moving the gripper.
    # If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper
    # above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the puck")
    # If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper
    # down to the puck to slide it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can
    # slide it to the target location.
    # Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")

# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    #  2. Push down on the button from the top
    # Because this is "topdown", we just need to line up the gripper from above.
    # Line up the robot's gripper from above.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")

# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
def window_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper left of the window handle
    #  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
    #  3. Push the window closed harder
    # If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the
    # gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("right of the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the
    # window close now by moving the gripper right.
    if check("the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("almost vertically aligned with the window handle")
    # If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle,
    # push harder.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the window handle")

# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
def pick_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```

Please write a program to perform the last task, `peg-insert-side`.
Begin with the text:

```
# peg-insert-side: insert the peg into the hole from the side
def peg_insert_side(robot):
