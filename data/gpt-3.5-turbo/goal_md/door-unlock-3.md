The task `door-unlock` can be completed by following these steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the door dial  2. Turn dial to the correct combination  3. Open the door
    First, move the robot's gripper near the door dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is near the dial, we can turn it to enter the correct combination to unlock the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door dial and the robot's gripper is not holding the dial, grab the dial with the gripper and turn it to enter the correct combination
    Once the correct combination has been entered, the door will be unlocked and we can open it.
    - When the door is unlocked, move the robot's gripper to the door handle and open the door.
