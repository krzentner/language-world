To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Position gripper in front of the dial  2. Rotate the dial in the correct direction to align the code  3. Repeat step 2 until the code is aligned and the dial unlocks

    We need to position the gripper in front of the dial to be able to rotate it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the dial
    Once the gripper is in front of the dial, we can rotate it in the correct direction to align the code.
    - Determine the correct direction to rotate the dial based on the code and the current position of the dial
    - Rotate the dial in the correct direction until the code is aligned
    If the code is not yet aligned and the dial is not stuck, repeat step 2 until the code is aligned and the dial unlocks.
