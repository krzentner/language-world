To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the hoop  4. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball
    If the gripper is above the ball, close the gripper to grab the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop
    Once the gripper is above the hoop, release the ball to drop it into the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the gripper is closed, release the ball into the hoop.
