Please see the steps below for the task `window-open`:
    
    1. Put gripper right of the window handle
    We need to position the gripper to the right of the window handle to be able to push it to slide open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the window handle, while still to the right of it.
    Once the gripper is in position, we can start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
    - When the robot's gripper is in position, start pushing against the window handle to slide it open to the left.
    If the window doesn't slide open easily, push harder until it does.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing the window handle, push harder until the window slides open to the left.
