To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Position the gripper near the bottom of the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Move the stick to grab the thermos handle  4. Move the thermos to the target location
First, position the gripper near the bottom of the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the bottom of the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the bottom of the stick
Once the gripper is near the bottom of the stick, close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is open and near the bottom of the stick, close the gripper around the stick
Now, move the stick to grab the thermos handle.
- When the stick is not holding the thermos handle, move the stick until it is holding the thermos handle
Once the stick has a good grip on the thermos handle, move the thermos to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the thermos handle and the thermos is not at the target location, move the thermos to the target location by moving the stick and the gripper.
