To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
    1. Position gripper above the stick
    2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    3. Move the gripper and stick to the thermos
    4. Place the stick under the thermos handle
    5. Pull the stick towards the target location to slide the thermos to the target location

First, position the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick
Once the gripper is above the stick, grab the stick with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick
Move the gripper and stick to the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the thermos
Place the stick under the thermos handle, making sure it can grip it properly.
- When the robot's gripper is near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is under the thermos handle
Finally, pull the stick towards the target location to slide the thermos to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is under the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper until the thermos has been slid to the target location.
