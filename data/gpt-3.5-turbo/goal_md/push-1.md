To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps: 1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Drop gripper around the puck 3. Close gripper around the puck  4. Push the puck towards the target location
   First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
   If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
   If the gripper is near the puck and closed, the robot can now push the puck towards the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, move the robot's gripper towards the target location.
