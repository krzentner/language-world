To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck.
2. Move the gripper down around the puck and close the gripper around it.
3. Lift the puck up.
4. Move the gripper to the target location.
5. Move the gripper down to place the puck at the target location and release it.
