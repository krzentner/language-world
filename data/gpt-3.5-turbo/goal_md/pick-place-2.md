To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Lift the puck  4. Move gripper to target location  5. Release the puck
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the puck, we should be able to grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not closed around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed around the puck
    Once the gripper is holding the puck, we can lift it.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    Next, move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Once the gripper is at the target location, we can release the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, release the puck by opening the gripper.
