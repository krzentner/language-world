To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above hole, near peg  2. Grab peg with gripper  3. Move gripper up to lift peg out of the hole  4. Move gripper to target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole, near the peg, making sure that the gripper is open.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg and gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open
    Once the gripper is near the peg, close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg
    After the gripper has grabbed the peg, lift it out of the hole by moving the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
    Once the peg is out of the hole, move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the target location
