To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial by rotating the gripper
    First, the robot needs to put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, the robot can turn the dial by rotating the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, rotate the robot's gripper until the dial is in the desired position
