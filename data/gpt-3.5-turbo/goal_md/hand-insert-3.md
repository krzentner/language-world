To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    Once the gripper is aligned with the puck, grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is holding the puck, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open, then release the puck at the target location.
