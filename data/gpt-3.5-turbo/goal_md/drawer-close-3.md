For the task `drawer-close`, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above drawer handle.  2. Push the drawer closed
    First, put the gripper above the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is above the drawer handle, we can just push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer.
