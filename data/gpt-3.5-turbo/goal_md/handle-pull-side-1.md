To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around handle  2. Pull handle up from the side
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the handle is not between the gripper fingers, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can pull up the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pulled all the way up.
