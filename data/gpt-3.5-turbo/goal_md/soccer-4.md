To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Line the ball up with the target location  4. Push the ball towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper is not around the ball, put it around the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the ball, line it up with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the ball is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Once the gripper is lined up with the ball and the target location, push the ball towards the target location.
    - When the ball is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location with the ball still in the gripper.
