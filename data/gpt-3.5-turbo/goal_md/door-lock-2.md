The steps the robot should perform to turn the dial on the door reliably are:

1. Put gripper near the dial handle
If the robot's gripper is not near the dial handle, move the gripper near the dial handle.

2. Grab the dial handle with the gripper
When the robot's gripper is near the dial handle, close the gripper around the handle to grab it.

3. Turn the dial handle to the correct position
Move the gripper handle to turn the dial to the correct position. The direction and number of turns will depend on the lock mechanism.

4. Release the dial handle
After the dial is turned to the correct position, release the dial handle by opening the gripper.
