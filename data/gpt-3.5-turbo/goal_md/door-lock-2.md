To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial knob  2. Rotate the gripper to turn the dial
    First, move the gripper above the dial knob and close the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial knob
    Once the gripper is around the dial knob, we can rotate the gripper to turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial knob, rotate the robot's gripper to turn the dial in the required direction to lock/unlock the door.
