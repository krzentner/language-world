To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably for `coffee-pull` task, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
- Put the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- Close the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- Lift the mug off the surface.
- Move the robot's gripper to the target location.
- Lower the mug onto the target location.

It is important to position the gripper accurately around the handle of the mug. Once the gripper is in position, the gripper should be closed securely around the handle before lifting the mug off the surface. The robot should then move the mug smoothly to the target location before lowering it onto the surface.
