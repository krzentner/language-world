    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Hold the mug with the gripper  4. Move the mug to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle to prepare for holding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
    Once the gripper is above the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is holding the mug, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is resting on the target location. Finally, release the mug by opening the gripper.
