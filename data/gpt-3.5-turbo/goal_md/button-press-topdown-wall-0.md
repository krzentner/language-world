To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the button above the wall  2. Move the robot towards the wall until the gripper touches the wall  3. Move the gripper down until it touches the button  4. Push down on the button from the top
    Because there is a wall in the way, we need to line up the gripper with the button above the wall first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button above the wall, move the robot's gripper until it is vertically aligned with the button above the wall and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is above the button and lined up, move the robot towards the wall until the gripper touches the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not touching the wall, move the robot towards the wall until the gripper touches the wall
    Once the gripper is touching the wall, move it down until it touches the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not touching the button, move the robot's gripper downwards until it is touching the button
    Now that the gripper is touching the button, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the button, move the robot's gripper until it is near the button, making sure not to move the robot forward and hit the wall.
