To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench upward and slightly away from the peg  4. Move the wrench away from the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is lined up with the wrench, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, lift the wrench upward and slightly away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not lifted upward and slightly away from the peg, lift the wrench upward and slightly away from the peg while maintaining the grip
    Once the wrench is lifted upward and slightly away from the peg, move the wrench away from the peg.
    - When the wrench is lifted upward and slightly away from the peg and the wrench is still over the peg, move the wrench away from the peg while maintaining the grip.
