The robot should perform the following steps to slide the puck to the target location reliably:
    Steps: 1. Put the gripper beside the puck and push it towards the target location
    Start by putting the gripper beside the puck and aligning it so that it won't bump into the puck while pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beside the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is beside the puck
    Once the gripper is beside the puck, start pushing it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is beside the puck, move the robot's gripper until the puck is at the target location.
