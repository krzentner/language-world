To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around door handle  2. Pull open the door
    First, the robot needs to move the gripper around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, the robot can pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle.
