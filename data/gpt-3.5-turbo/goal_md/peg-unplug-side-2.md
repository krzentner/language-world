To unplug the peg from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the peg  2. Pull the peg out horizontally
    First, position the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, pull the peg out horizontally from the socket.
    - When the peg is not out of the hole and the robot's gripper is around the peg and in the same direction as the peg's horizontal axis, move the robot's gripper sideways until the peg is pulled out of the hole.
