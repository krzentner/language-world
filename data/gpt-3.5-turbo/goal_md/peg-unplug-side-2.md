To pull the peg out of its socket from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the peg  2. Grab onto the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg sideways out of the socket
    First, put the gripper near the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg
    Once the gripper is near the peg, we should grab onto it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull it out of the socket by sliding it sideways. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sideways to the socket
