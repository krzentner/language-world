To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Position the gripper above the cube and center it.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the center of the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the center of the cube.
2. Close the gripper around the center of the cube.
   - When the robot's gripper is not closed around the center of the cube, close the robot's gripper around the center of the cube.
3. Raise the gripper enough to clear the table or floor.
   - When the robot's gripper is not raised above the table or floor, raise the robot's gripper until it clears the table or floor.
4. Move the gripper and cube to the target location while keeping the gripper parallel to the ground.
   - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper and cube until the gripper is near the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is not parallel to the ground, adjust the angle of the robot's gripper until it is parallel to the ground.
5. Lower the gripper to place the cube at the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until it is above the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is not lowered to place the cube at the target location, lower the gripper until the cube is placed at the target location.
