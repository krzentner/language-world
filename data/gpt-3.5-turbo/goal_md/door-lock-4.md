To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper on the dial  2. Turn the dial to the desired combination
    First, we need to position the gripper on the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the dial and closed, we can try turning the dial to the desired combination.
    - Turn the dial until the desired combination is reached. This may require multiple attempts with different directions and turn strengths.
