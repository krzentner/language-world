To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Move gripper towards the door lock  2. Turn the dial in the correct direction to unlock the door
First, move the gripper towards the door lock so that we can access the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door lock, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door lock
Once the gripper is near the dial, we need to turn it in the correct direction to unlock the door.
- Determine the correct direction to turn the dial based on the lock's requirements (clockwise or counterclockwise)
- When the dial is not turned in the correct direction, turn the dial in the correct direction until the lock is unlocked
