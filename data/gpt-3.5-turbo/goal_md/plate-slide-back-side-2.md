To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the edge of the plate with the gripper  3. Lift the plate slightly off the surface  4. Move the gripper and plate sideways towards the target location  5. Lower the plate onto the surface in the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is not gripping the plate yet, grip the edge of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not gripping the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is gripping the edge of the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Lift the plate slightly off the surface, so that it can be moved sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is gripping the plate but not lifted, move the robot's gripper until the plate is slightly lifted off the surface
    Move the gripper and plate sideways towards the target location.
    - When the plate is slightly lifted off the surface and the robot's gripper is gripping the plate and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper and plate sideways towards the target location
    Lower the plate onto the surface in the target location.
    - When the plate is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is lowered onto the surface in the target location and the robot's gripper is open
