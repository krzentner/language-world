To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench up and off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the wrench handle
    Once the gripper is positioned above the wrench handle, close the gripper to grab the wrench.
    - When the gripper is not closed and in contact with the wrench, close the gripper until it holds the wrench
    Finally, pull the wrench up and off the peg.
    - When the gripper has grabbed the wrench, move the robot's gripper upwards until the wrench is off the peg.
