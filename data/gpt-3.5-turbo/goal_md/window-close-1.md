To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder

If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
- When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle

If the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, we can probably slide the window closed now by moving the gripper right.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle.
