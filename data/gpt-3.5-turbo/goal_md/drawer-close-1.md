The robot should perform the following steps to push the drawer close reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of drawer handle  2. Push to close the drawer
    First, put the gripper near the front of the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer handle
    Once the gripper is in front of the drawer handle, the robot can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is away from the drawer and the drawer is closed.
