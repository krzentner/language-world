The robot should perform the following steps to reliably rotate the lever up:
   Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever  2. Pull the lever upwards
   First, the robot needs to position the gripper around the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever
   Once the gripper is around the lever, the robot can simply pull the lever upwards.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper upwards until the lever is rotated up.
