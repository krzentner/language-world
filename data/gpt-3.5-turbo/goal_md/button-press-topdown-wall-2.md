To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Move the robot's gripper to the top of the short wall
2. Slide the gripper down the wall until it is above the button
3. Line up the gripper as viewed from above with the button
4. Push down on the button from the top

Because of the short wall, the robot needs to first move its gripper to the top of the wall so that it can slide down the wall until it is above the button. Once the gripper is above the button, it needs to be lined up correctly from above before pushing down on the button from the top.
