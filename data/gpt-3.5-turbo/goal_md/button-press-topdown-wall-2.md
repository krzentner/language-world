To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the button while avoiding the wall 2. Lower the gripper to the button and push it down

Because of the wall, we will need to approach the button from an angle.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the button and the robot's gripper can't fit between the wall and the button, move the robot's gripper until it is above the button and can fit between the wall and the button
Now that the gripper is lined up from the side, we can lower it down to the button and push it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and there is no obstruction, move the robot's gripper down until it touches the button, then push down on the button.
