To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Move the gripper to the edge of the wall closest to the target location
2. Extend the gripper over the wall towards the target location
3. Move the gripper down to the target location

To execute these steps, we can first move the gripper to the edge of the wall closest to the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is not near the edge of the wall closest to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the edge of the wall closest to the target location.

Then, we need to extend the gripper over the wall towards the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the edge of the wall closest to the target location but the target location is on the other side of the wall, extend the robot's gripper over the wall until it is above the target location. 

Finally, we can move the gripper down to the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is over the target location, move the robot's gripper down until the robot's gripper is near the target location. 

By following these steps, the robot can reliably reach the target location with a short wall in the way.
