To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the faucet handle  2. Turn the faucet left
    First, put the gripper mostly around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is mostly around the handle, closing it should fully grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the faucet handle, turning it left should turn on the water.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the faucet handle, turn the faucet left.
