To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around faucet head  2. Turn the faucet handle to the left
    First, put the gripper around the faucet head to have a strong grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around faucet head, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet head
    Once the gripper is around the faucet head, turn the faucet handle to the left to open it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around faucet head, turn the faucet handle to the left until the faucet is open
