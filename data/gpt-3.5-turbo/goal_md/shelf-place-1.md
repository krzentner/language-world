The robot should perform the following steps for the `shelf-place` task:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the block
       2. Drop gripper around the block
       3. Close gripper around the block
       4. Lift the block
       5. Move the gripper to the target location
       6. Lower the block
       7. Release the gripper

Firstly, the robot should position its gripper above the block to avoid collisions. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the block.

Then, the gripper should be lowered around the block to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed.

Once the gripper has a firm grip, the block can be lifted.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is closed, lift the block by moving the robot's gripper upward.

The block can then be moved to its target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block, move the robot's gripper to the target location.

Once the block reaches its target location, it can be lowered into place.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, lower the block by moving the robot's gripper downward.

Finally, the gripper should release the block.
- When the block is in place, open the gripper to release it.
