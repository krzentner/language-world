The robot should first position the gripper above the peg and grab it. Then, it should lift the peg out of the hole and position it near the target location. Finally, the gripper should release the peg at the target location. Here are the detailed steps:

1. Put gripper above the peg in the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed

2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg

3. Lift the peg out of the hole.
- Move the robot's gripper upwards until the peg is clear of the hole.

4. Position the peg near the target location.
- Move the gripper to the target location while making sure that the peg doesn't swing or hit anything.

5. Release the peg at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is around the peg, open the gripper to release the peg.
