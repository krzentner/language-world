The steps that the robot should perform to pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably are:

1. Put gripper above the peg hole
2. Move the gripper down into the hole until it touches the peg
3. Close the gripper around the peg
4. Lift the gripper out of the hole and move it to the target location
5. Release the peg by opening the gripper

First, put the gripper above the peg hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg hole
Once the gripper is lined up with the peg, move it down into the hole until it touches the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and is not near the peg hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and is inside the hole
Close the gripper around the peg to pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and is not closed, close the gripper around the peg
Lift the gripper out of the hole and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the peg and is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
Release the peg by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and is not open, open the gripper to release the peg.
