To slide the window open to the left, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window  3. Push the window open harder
    If the window handle is left of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is closed
