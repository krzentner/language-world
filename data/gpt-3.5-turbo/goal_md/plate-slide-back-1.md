To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper near the plate  2. Push gripper into the plate to trap it against the surface  3. Slide the plate back to target location
    If the plate is not below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper near the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is not trapping the plate against the surface yet, push down on the plate from above to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is not pushing down on the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing down on the plate
    Once the plate is trapped, slide it back to the target location by moving the robot's gripper and maintaining downward pressure on the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing down on the plate and the plate is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location.
