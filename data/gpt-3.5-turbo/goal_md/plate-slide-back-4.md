To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind the plate 2. Push the plate towards the target location
    We can push the plate by placing the gripper behind it and pushing it towards the target location. If the gripper is not behind the plate, move it behind the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is behind the plate
    If the gripper is behind the plate and not near it, move it closer to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    Once the gripper is near the plate, we can push it back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is in the target location.
