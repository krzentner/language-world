To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck and in front of the wall  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Lift the puck so that it clears the wall  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Lower the gripper with the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck and in front of the wall. This is necessary because the gripper cannot grab the puck when it is directly behind the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not in front of the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and in front of the wall
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once we have a good grip on the puck, we need to lift it so that it clears the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck, lift the puck until it clears the wall
    After the puck has cleared the wall, move the gripper with the puck to the target location.
    - When the gripper with the puck is not above the target location, move the gripper with the puck until it is above the target location
    Finally, lower the gripper with the puck to the target location.
    - When the gripper with the puck is above the target location, lower the gripper with the puck until it is at the target location.
