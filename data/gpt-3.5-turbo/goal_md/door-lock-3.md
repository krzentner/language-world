The steps the robot should perform to turn the dial on the door reliably are:

    1. Put gripper roughly around the dial
    We need to put the gripper around the dial first to be able to turn it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Once the gripper is around the dial, position the gripper's fingers in the correct position around the dial, so that we can turn it easily without slipping off.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial and the gripper's fingers are not in the correct position, adjust the position of the gripper's fingers
    
    2. Turn the dial
    Once the gripper is in position, we can turn the dial. We need to determine the direction of rotation based on the current position of the dial and the desired lock position.
    - Determine the direction of rotation based on the current position of the dial and the desired lock position
    - Turn the dial the necessary amount in the determined direction to reach the desired lock position. 
    This can be done by rotating the gripper, or by moving the robot's whole arm if necessary.
    - When the dial reaches the desired lock position, release the dial with the gripper.
