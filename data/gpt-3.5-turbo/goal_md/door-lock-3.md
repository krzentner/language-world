To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial of the door  2. Turn the dial in the correct direction to lock or unlock the door
    First, move the gripper to be around the dial of the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial of the door
    Once the gripper is around the dial, we can turn it in the desired direction to lock or unlock the door.
    - Turn the dial in the correct direction to lock or unlock the door
