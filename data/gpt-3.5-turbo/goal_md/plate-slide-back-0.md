To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the plate  2. Push gripper into top of plate  3. Slide plate to target location
    The robot can slide the plate by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the plate isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper near the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    If the gripper is near the plate but not aligned with it, move the gripper down onto the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, we can probably trap the plate by closing the gripper and then sliding it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
