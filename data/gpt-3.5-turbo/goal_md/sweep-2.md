To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above one end of the cube
2. Drop gripper around the cube
3. Close gripper around the cube
4. Lift the cube before sliding it to the target location
5. Move the gripper sideways towards the target location
6. Lower the gripper to place the cube on the target location.

First, put the gripper above one end of the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above one end of the cube, move the robot's gripper until it is.
If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the cube and then close the gripper around the cube.
If the gripper is around the cube, lift the cube before sliding it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube, lift the cube by moving the robot's arm upwards.
Move the gripper sideways towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is not sideways aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper sideways towards the target location with the cube held within the gripper.
Lower the gripper to place the cube on the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location sideways and the robot's gripper is above the target location, lower the robot's gripper to place the cube on the target location.
