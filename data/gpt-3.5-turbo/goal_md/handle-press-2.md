The steps the robot should perform to push down the handle reliably are:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the handle, grab the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pressed down.
