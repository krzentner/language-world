To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the side of the hole
    First, put the gripper roughly above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    If the gripper is not around the peg, put it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the peg, pull it out from the side of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the peg is out of the hole and the robot's gripper is above the peg
