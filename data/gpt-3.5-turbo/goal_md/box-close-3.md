To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the box lid 
2. Drop gripper around the box lid 
3. Close gripper around the box lid 
4. Move the lid to the top of the box 
5. Release the lid by opening the gripper

First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the box lid and closed, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper. Once the gripper is closed around the box lid, lift the lid and place it on top of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the top of the box
Finally, release the lid by opening the gripper when it's in the correct position on the top of the box.
