To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above box lid  2. Drop gripper around box lid  3. Close the gripper around the lid  4. Move the gripper to the box  5. Adjust the gripper to align the box lid with the box  6. Release the gripper to place the lid on the box

First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
Once the gripper is above the box lid, we can grab the lid by dropping the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is not around the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lid and the robot's gripper is closed
With the lid in the gripper, we need to move it to the box but be careful not to bump any other objects.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box
Once the gripper is near the box, we can adjust the position of the lid to align it with the box.
- When the robot's gripper is near the box and the box is not aligned with the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the box lid is aligned with the box
Finally, we can release the gripper to place the lid on the box.
- When the box lid is aligned with the box and the robot's gripper is closed, release the gripper to place the lid on the box
