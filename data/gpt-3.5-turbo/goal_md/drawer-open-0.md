The robot should perform the following steps to reliably pull the drawer open:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Pull the drawer open
    If the gripper is not near the drawer handle, move it to the drawer handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the drawer is large and we're just pulling it (unlike when closing the drawer).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
    If the drawer handle is above the gripper as seen from in front, we can pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle
