To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper around faucet handle  2. Turn gripper left to open the faucet
To open the faucet, we need to grab the handle with the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
Once we have a good grip on the handle, we can turn the handle left to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the gripper left to open the faucet
