To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet knob  2. Turn the knob to the right to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper around the faucet knob.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob
    Once the gripper is around the knob, we can turn the knob to the right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob to the right to close the faucet
