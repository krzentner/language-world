    First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle to the right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle to the right.
