To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put the gripper above the mug
2. Grab the mug with the gripper
3. Lift the mug off the surface
4. Move the gripped mug to the target location
5. Put the gripper above the table
6. Release the mug from the gripper

First, put the gripper roughly above the mug, so that we can grab it without knocking it over.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug
If the gripper is not around the mug, we need to put the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper is not around mug and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
Now that we have the mug in the gripper, lift it off the surface to start moving it.
- When the mug is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the mug is lifted
We need to move the gripped mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location and the mug is still gripped, move the gripped mug to the target location
Once we reach the target location, put the gripper above the table and release the mug from the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the table and the mug is still gripped, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the table
- When the robot's gripper is above the table and the mug is still gripped, release the mug from the gripper
