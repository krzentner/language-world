To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Drop gripper around the mug handle  3. Lift the mug up  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Lower the mug down

First, put the gripper above the mug, so that we have an easy view of it and can coordinate the movement of the gripper with the position of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug

Next, we need to grab the mug by maneuvering the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed

After the mug is grabbed, lift it up so that it can be moved to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the mug is lifted up and the gripper is above the table

Now we can move the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the table, move the robot's gripper until the mug is moved to the target location

Finally, we can lower the mug down onto the target location.
- When the mug is moved to the target location, move the robot's gripper until the mug is lowered down onto the target location
