The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific value.
To turn the dial to a specific value reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial handle  2. Drop gripper around dial handle  3. Turn the dial to the desired value
    First, put the gripper above the dial handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with dial handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the dial handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the dial handle, we should be able to grab the dial handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the dial handle and the robot's gripper is not around the dial handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial handle
    Once the gripper is around the dial handle, we can turn the dial to the desired value.
    - When the robot's gripper is around dial handle, turn the dial to the desired value by rotating the gripper around the dial handle.
