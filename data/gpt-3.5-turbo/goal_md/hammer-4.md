The task `hammer` requires the robot to hit the nail with the hammer. To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Position the hammer above the nail
           2. Close the gripper on the handle of the hammer
           3. Lift the hammer above the nail
           4. Position the hammer directly above the nail
           5. The robot should now swing the hammer down and hit the nail on its head. 
           6. Repeat until the nail is fully driven in.

Note: This task requires a lot more precision and accuracy than other tasks. Careful calibration and control will be necessary to ensure that the robot hits the nail with the hammer consistently and accurately.
