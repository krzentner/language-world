To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Drop gripper around the cube  3. Close gripper around the cube  4. Lift cube up  5. Move gripper above the target bin  6. Lower the cube into the target bin  7. Open gripper
    First, put the gripper above the cube that needs to be picked.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Then, drop the gripper around the cube and close it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    After the gripper has successfully picked up the cube, lift it up to avoid any obstacles while moving it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, lift the robot's gripper up
    Next, move the gripper above the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
    Then, lower the cube into the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, move the robot's gripper down until the cube is in the bin
    Finally, open the gripper to release the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside the bin, open the robot's gripper to release the cube.
