To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Line up gripper above the puck 2. Push gripper into top of puck 3. Slide puck backwards to goal

The robot can slide the puck backwards in a similar manner as sliding it forward. First, line up the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
