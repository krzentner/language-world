To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet knob  2. Turn the knob clockwise to close the faucet
    First, the robot should move its gripper around the faucet knob to get a good grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet knob, move the robot's gripper until it is around the faucet knob
    Once the gripper is around the knob, the robot can turn it clockwise to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob clockwise to close the faucet.
