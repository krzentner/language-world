To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Close gripper around plate  3. Slide the plate to goal
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is not closed around the plate, close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the target location, we can slide the plate to the goal. Start sliding it by moving the gripper in the direction of the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
