To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate, aligned with the center of the plate  2. Push gripper into the top of the plate  3. Slide the plate towards the target location  4. Release the plate
    First, put the gripper above the plate, aligned with the center of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and centered, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the center of the plate
    If the gripper is not aligned with the top of the plate, move it down to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the center of the plate and the robot's gripper is not touching the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing down on the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is pushing down on the plate, the robot should be able to slide it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is touching the plate, move the robot's gripper towards the target location
    Once the plate is aligned with the target location, release the plate from the gripper.
    - When the plate is aligned with the target location, open the robot's gripper to release the plate.
