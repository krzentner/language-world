The task `hammer` requires the robot to hit the nail with the hammer.
To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Align the hammer with the nail  2. Move the hammer down to hit the nail  3. Lift the hammer back up
    First, align the hammer with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the hammer is lined up, move it down to hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is down near the nail
    After the hammer has hit the nail, lift the hammer back up.
    - When the hammer is down near the nail, move the robot's gripper until the hammer is back up again
