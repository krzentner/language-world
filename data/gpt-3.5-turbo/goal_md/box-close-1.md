To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above box lid handle  2. Drop gripper around box lid handle  3. Close gripper around box lid handle  4. Pick up the box lid and move it to the top of the box
    First, put the gripper above the box lid handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the box lid handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the box lid handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the box lid handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid handle
    Once the gripper is above the box lid handle, we can grab the lid by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box lid handle and the robot's gripper is not around the box lid handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the box lid handle
    Once the gripper is around the box lid handle, we can lift the lid and move it to the top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the box lid handle, move the robot's gripper until the box lid is above the box
    Once the box lid is above the box, we can place the lid on the box by opening the gripper and releasing the lid.
