The robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper near the cube 2. Push the cube slowly until it slides into the gripper 3. Lift the gripper with the cube inside and move towards the target location 4. Release the cube at the target location

First, put the gripper near the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, move the robot's gripper until it is near the cube
Once the gripper is close to the cube, we need to move the gripper towards the cube slowly to allow it to slide into the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is not holding the cube, move the robot's gripper slowly into the cube until the cube is inside the gripper
After the cube is inside the gripper, lift the gripper and move it towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the robot's gripper is not above the target location, lift the gripper with the cube inside and move it towards the target location
Finally, release the cube at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the cube, release the cube at the target location.
