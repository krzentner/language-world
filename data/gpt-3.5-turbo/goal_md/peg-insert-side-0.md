To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper near the peg 
2. Drop gripper around the peg 
3. Close gripper around the peg 
4. Align the gripper and peg with the hole's opening 
5. Insert the peg into the hole
6. Release the gripper from the peg

First, put the gripper near the peg and make sure it's not too far away.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg

Once the gripper is near enough to the peg, make sure the gripper is around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed

Next, align the gripper and peg with the opening of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is centered over the hole opening

After the gripper and peg are aligned with the opening, insert the peg into the hole by moving the gripper closer to the hole and pushing the peg inside.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the hole and the peg is not inside the hole, move the robot's gripper until the peg is inside the hole

Finally, release the gripper from the peg by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, open the gripper to release the peg
