To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the plate  2. Slide gripper under the plate  3. Lift gripper and plate up  4. Move gripper and plate to goal location  5. Slide the plate off the gripper and onto the target location
    First, put the gripper near the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
    Slide the gripper under the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is not under the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is under the plate
    Lift up the gripper and plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is under the plate and the robot's gripper is not lifted, lift the gripper and plate up
    Move the gripper and plate to the goal location.
    - When the gripper and plate are lifted and the robot's gripper is not near the goal location, move the gripper and plate to the goal location
    Slide the plate off the gripper and onto the target location.
    - When the gripper and plate are near the goal location and the robot's gripper is not slid out from under the plate, slide the gripper out from under the plate and onto the target location
