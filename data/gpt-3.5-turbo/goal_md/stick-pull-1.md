To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the stick near the thermos
    - When the stick is not near the thermos, move the stick until it's near the thermos
2. Grip the stick around the thermos
    - When the stick is not around the thermos and the stick is near the thermos, grab it around the thermos with the gripper
3. Move the stick in the direction of the target location
    - If the thermos is not aligned with the target location, move the stick in the direction of the target location while keeping the gripper around the thermos
4. Release the grip once the thermos is at the target location
    - When the thermos reaches the target location, release the stick's gripper to drop the thermos at the target location.
