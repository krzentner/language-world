To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the stick  2. Move the stick to the thermos handle  3. Connect the stick to the thermos handle  4. Slide the thermos to the target location by pulling the stick and pushing the thermos
    First, position the gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, move the stick to the thermos handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick but the stick is not close to the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper until the stick is close to the thermos handle
    Once the stick is connected to the thermos handle, slide the thermos to the target location by pulling the stick and pushing the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is connected to the thermos handle by using the stick and the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
