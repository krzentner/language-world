To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper near the plate 2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper and slide the plate back to the target location
First, put the gripper near the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate
Next, grab the plate with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper around the plate and close the gripper
Once the gripper is around the plate, move the gripper and slide the plate back to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper along the horizontal direction until the plate is at the target location.
