    If the gripper isn't around the hammer handle, put it around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the hammer handle, close it to grab it. Then, move the gripper above the nail head.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the hammer head is above the nail head
