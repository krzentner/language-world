To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the faucet handle  2. Turn the gripper to the right to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can start turning to close the faucet.
    - While the faucet is not fully turned or the gripper is not fully right, continuously turn the gripper to the right until the faucet is fully closed.
