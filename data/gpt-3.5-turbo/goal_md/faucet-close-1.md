To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet handle  2. Turn the handle right to close the faucet
    First, move the robot's gripper to put it around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, turn the handle to the right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle right until the faucet is closed.
