    Steps: 1. Move the gripper above the wall  2. Move the gripper to the target location
    First, move the gripper above the wall so that it can see the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, move it towards the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location.
