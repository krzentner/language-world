To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Check if the wall is in the way of the gripper's straight line toward the target location
    If the wall is not in the way, execute the regular steps for the `reach` task.
    If the wall is in the way, move the robot's gripper to the closest point where the gripper's straight line is not obstructed by the wall. This point is found by extending a line from the gripper to the target location and finding where the line intersects the edge of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is obstructed by the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the closest point where the gripper's straight line is not obstructed by the wall.
    Once the gripper is at the closest point, proceed with the regular steps for the `reach` task by moving the gripper towards the target location until the robot's gripper is near the reach target.
