To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Close gripper around stick  4. Use stick to pull the thermos to the target location
   First, put the gripper above the stick to avoid bumping into it while grasping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
   Next, drop the gripper around the stick and close the gripper to firmly grasp it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
   Once we have a firm grasp on the stick, we can use it to pull the thermos to the target location.
    - When the robot has a firm grasp on the stick, move the stick to attach to the thermos and pull the thermos to the target location. Once the thermos is at the target location, release the stick by opening the gripper.
