To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
            3. Put the gripper above the thermos  4. Drop the gripper around the thermos  5. Hold the thermos in place  6. Slide the stick to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick
    Once the gripper is above the stick, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now put the gripper above the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the thermos, we can hold it in place.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    If the gripper is above the target location, we can slide the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the stick has pulled the thermos to the target location
