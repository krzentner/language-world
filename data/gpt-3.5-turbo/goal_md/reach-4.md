The task `reach` is a bit ambiguous, as it doesn't specify what the robot is supposed to do once it reaches the target location. However, assuming that the robot needs to reach the target location without grabbing or pushing anything, the following steps may be taken:

Steps: 1. Position the gripper above the starting location  2. Move the gripper above the target location while avoiding obstacles  3. Position the gripper precisely above the target location  
   
To move the robot's gripper above the target location while avoiding obstacles, the robot should use a suitable path planning algorithm to generate a safe path. The robot should also have sensors to detect obstacles or potential collisions. Once the robot has safely reached the target location, it can stop moving and wait for further instruction or perform any necessary task.
