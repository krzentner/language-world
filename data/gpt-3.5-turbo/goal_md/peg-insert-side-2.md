To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. Line the peg up with the hole.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole.
- When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg.
