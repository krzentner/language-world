To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around the soccer ball  3. Close gripper around the soccer ball  4. Push the soccer ball towards the target
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while still holding onto the soccer ball.
