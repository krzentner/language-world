To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Close gripper around soccer ball  4. Move soccer ball to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and closed, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location. Finally, open the gripper to let go of the soccer ball at the target location.
