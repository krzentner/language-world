To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the soccer ball  2. Push gripper into the side of the soccer ball  3. Roll the ball towards the target location using the gripper
    Since the soccer ball is round, we can't just trap it like the puck. Instead, we should put the gripper near the ball and push into the ball from the side to roll it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't pushing into the ball, push it into the side of the ball to get it to start rolling.
    - Keep pushing the ball towards the target location using the gripper, adjusting the direction as needed.
