To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper to the dial  2. Grip the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial in the required direction until it unlocks the door
    First, move the gripper to the dial on the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial
    Once the gripper is near the dial, grip it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial
    Finally, turn the dial in the required direction until it unlocks the door. For this, we may need to try turning the dial both clockwise and anti-clockwise to find the correct direction to unlock the door.
