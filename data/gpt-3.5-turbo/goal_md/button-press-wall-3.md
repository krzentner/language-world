To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper in front of the button and wall  2. Move gripper to top of the button  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the gripper in front of the button and wall so that we can see the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button and the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the button and the wall
    Once the gripper is lined up with the button and the wall, move the gripper to the top of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    After the gripper is above the button, push down on the button to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
