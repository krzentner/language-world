To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper next to the button's side  2. Push the button forward  3. Push the button down
    Since there is a short wall in front of the button, we need to approach it from the side. Put the gripper next to the button's side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not next to the button's side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is next to the button's side
    Once the gripper is next to the button's side, push the button forward to slide it past the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is next to the button's side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button
    After sliding the button past the wall, now we can push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
