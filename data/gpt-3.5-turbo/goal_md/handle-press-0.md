The task `handle-press` can be performed reliably if the robot follows these steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Push the handle down
    First, the robot should align its gripper vertically with the handle by placing its gripper above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on the handle to activate it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
