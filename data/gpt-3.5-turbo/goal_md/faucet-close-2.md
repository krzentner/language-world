To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the faucet handle  2. Drop gripper around the faucet handle  3. Turn the handle to the right
    First, put the gripper mostly above the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle
    If the gripper is near the faucet handle, we can turn the handle to the right to close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the handle is facing right. Then, close the gripper around the faucet handle and turn the handle to the right.
