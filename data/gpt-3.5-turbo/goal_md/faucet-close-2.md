To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper around faucet knob  2. Turn the knob right to close the faucet
First, move the gripper to be around the faucet knob.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob
Once the gripper is around the knob, we can turn it to close the faucet.
- Turn the faucet knob right to close it.
