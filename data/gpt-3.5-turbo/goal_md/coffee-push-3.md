To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Drop gripper around the mug handle  3. Close gripper around the mug handle  4. Lift the mug off the surface  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Lower the mug onto the surface
    First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle, but a little bit to the side because we need to grab the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not roughly above the mug handle and is not to the side of the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is roughly above the mug handle and to the side of the mug handle
    Once the gripper is roughly above the mug handle, we should drop the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle, we should close the gripper around the handle and lift the mug off the surface.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the mug is not lifted off the surface, move the robot's gripper upwards to lift the mug off the surface
    Once the mug is lifted off the surface, we can move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Once the gripper is above the target location, we can lower the mug onto the surface at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is lifted off the surface, move the robot's gripper downwards to lower the mug onto the surface
