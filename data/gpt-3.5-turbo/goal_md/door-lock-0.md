To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial to the correct combination
    First, position the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial
    As long as the gripper is around the dial, we can try turning it to the correct combination.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the required combination, following the specified sequence of turns.
