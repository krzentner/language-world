To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench so that we can grab it easily.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper has a good hold on the wrench, pull the wrench off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is no longer attached to the peg
