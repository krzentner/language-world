To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Move gripper down to the button  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the gripper roughly above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button
    Once the gripper is above the button, move the gripper down to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
    Once the gripper is near the button, we can push down on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the button is pressed down
