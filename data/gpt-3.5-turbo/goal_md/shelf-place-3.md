To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Move gripper to target location  4. Release the block
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the block and the gripper is closed, move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and the block is gripped securely, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Once the gripper is above the target location, release the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, release the block by opening the gripper.
