To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper around the door handle  2. Turn dial until the door unlocks
First, put the gripper around the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
Once the gripper is around the door handle, turn the dial until the door unlocks.
- When the door is not unlocked, turn the dial until the door unlocks.
