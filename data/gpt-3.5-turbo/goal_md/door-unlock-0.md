To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    1. Put gripper above the dial
    2. Grab the dial with the gripper
    3. Turn the dial to the required number combination
    4. Release the dial
    
First, move the robot's gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the dial
Next, grip the dial with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the required number combination.
    - When the robot has not turned the dial to the required number combination, turn the dial until the required combination is shown
Finally, release the dial and return the gripper to its original position.
    - Open the gripper around the dial and move the robot's gripper back to its original position.
