To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle from the side  2. Lift the handle up
    First, put the gripper around the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the handle is not almost vertically aligned with the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is almost vertically aligned with the gripper
    Once the gripper is around the handle and the handle is roughly lined up with the gripper, we can lift the handle up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is almost vertically aligned with the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the handle is fully lifted up.
