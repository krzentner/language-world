    Steps: 1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle upwards
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, pull it upwards to complete the task.
