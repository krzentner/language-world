The robot should perform the following steps to pull up the handle reliably:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pulled up
