To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, the robot needs to put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is around the handle, the robot can push down on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is still around the handle. Then, push down on the handle from the side.
