To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Align the gripper with the plate  2. Push the plate towards the target location
    First, align the gripper with the plate to minimize any chance of knocking it over.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the plate, push the plate towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location.
