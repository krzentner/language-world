To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the middle of the drawer  2. Push the middle part of the drawer to close it
    First, put the gripper above the middle part of the drawer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the middle of the drawer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the middle of the drawer and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the middle part of the drawer, push down on it to push the drawer close.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the middle of the drawer, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the middle of the drawer
