To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around faucet handle  2. Turn the handle left
    First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle left to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle left until the desired water flow rate is achieved.
