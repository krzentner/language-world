To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps: 1. Put gripper around faucet handle  2. Twist the handle left to turn on the faucet
   First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
   Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can turn the handle left to turn on the faucet.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, twist the handle left to turn on the faucet.
