To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the top of the peg  2. Open gripper  3. Move gripper to the side of the hole  4. Align gripper with the hole  5. Move gripper to insert peg  6. Close gripper to hold peg in place  7. Push the peg into the hole
    First, put the gripper near the top of the peg, so that we have a good grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the top of the peg, move the robot's gripper until it is near the top of the peg
    Open the gripper so that we can grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the top of the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, open the robot's gripper
    Move the gripper to the side of the hole where we will insert the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper to the side of the hole
    Align the gripper with the hole so that we can insert the peg.
    - When the gripper is near the hole, move the robot's gripper until it is aligned with the hole
    Move the gripper to insert the peg into the hole, then close the gripper to hold the peg in place.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the hole and open, move the robot's gripper to insert the peg and then close gripper
    Finally, push the peg into the hole to complete the task.
