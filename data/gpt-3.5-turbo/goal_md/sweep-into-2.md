To grab the cube and move it into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put the gripper near the cube
2. Open the gripper
3. Move the gripper around the cube to grasp it from the side
4. Close the gripper around the cube
5. Lift the cube up and move it towards the target location
6. Lower the cube down to the target location

First, put the gripper near the cube, without touching it, so that we can grasp the cube without knocking it over.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube

Next, open the gripper so that it can grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not open, open the robot's gripper

Once the gripper is open, move the gripper around the cube so that it can grasp the cube from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube, move the robot's gripper around the cube until the robot's gripper is able to grasp the cube from the side

Once the gripper is around the cube, close the gripper to firmly hold onto the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not closed around the cube, close the robot's gripper around the cube

With the cube in the gripper, move it towards the target location by lifting the cube up and moving it forward.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the grip is secure, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location

Finally, move the gripper down to the target location and release the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper down until the robot's gripper is at the target location and then open the gripper to release the cube.
