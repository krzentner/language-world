To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Lift the puck up  4. Move the gripper to the target location  5. Lower the puck down
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    Once the gripper is aligned with the puck, grab the puck by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck
    Next, lift the puck up by moving the gripper upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    Move the gripper to the target location with the puck held securely.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until it is at the target location
    Finally, lower the puck down by moving the gripper downwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the puck is not near the ground, move the robot's gripper until the puck is near the ground
