To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Grab the mug handle with the gripper  3. Lift the mug up slightly  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Lower the mug to the target location
First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the mug handle, lift the mug up slightly to ensure a good grip.
- When the robot's gripper has a grip on the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the mug is above the target location at a safe height for transport
If the robot's gripper is above the target location and at the safe height for transport, move the mug to the target location.
- When the mug is above the target location and at the safe height for transport, move the robot's gripper until the mug is at the target location and at a safe height for placement
Finally, lower the mug to the target location.
