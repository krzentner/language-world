To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper around the handle of the mug.
2. Lift the mug and move the gripper towards the target location.
3. Lower the mug down at the target location.

First, position the gripper around the handle of the mug. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug.
Next, lift the mug and move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the mug is not lifted and the robot's gripper is not near the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is closed.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper towards the target location.
Finally, lower the mug down at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location with the mug, move the robot's gripper downward until the robot's gripper is at the target location. Then, release the mug from the gripper.
