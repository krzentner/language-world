To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Drop gripper around the box lid  3. Close gripper around the box lid  4. Move gripper to box  5. Open gripper to place lid on box
    First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the box lid and closed, we have picked it up. Now, we should move the gripper to the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the box is underneath the gripper
    Now that the gripper is above the box, we can release the lid to place it on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box, open the gripper to place the lid on the box.
