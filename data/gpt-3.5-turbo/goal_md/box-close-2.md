To close the box with the lid, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lid  2. Drop gripper around lid  3. Close gripper around lid  4. Move lid to box  5. Open gripper to release lid
    First, put the gripper above the lid, so that we don't bump into it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lid
    If the gripper isn't around the lid, put it around the lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lid and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the lid and closed, we can grab it by lifting it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
    If the gripper is above the box, we can place the lid on top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the box with the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open to release the lid onto the box.
