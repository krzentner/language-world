The task `lever-pull` requires the robot to rotate the lever up. To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the lever handle  2. Grab the lever handle with the gripper  3. Rotate the lever handle up.

First, the robot needs to put the gripper above the lever handle so that it can grab it properly.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever handle

Once the gripper is above the lever handle, we can grab the handle with the gripper.
     - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever handle and the robot's gripper is not around lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever handle

Once the gripper is around the lever handle, we can rotate the lever handle up.
    - Rotate the lever handle up until it clicks or reaches its maximum up position. 

Note: Depending on the design of the lever, the robot may need to grip it firmly enough to prevent slippage while rotating it upwards.
