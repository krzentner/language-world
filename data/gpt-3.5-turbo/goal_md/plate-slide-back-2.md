To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the plate
    2. Put the gripper around the plate
    3. Lift the plate slightly to reduce friction with the surface
    4. Slide the plate back to the target location
    When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate but not around it, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around it and the robot's gripper is closed.
    To reduce the friction with the surface, lift the plate slightly.
    - Lift the plate slightly using the robot's gripper
    After reducing the friction, slide the plate back to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate touches the target location.
