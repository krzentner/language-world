To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper at edge of the plate  2. Push the plate backwards towards the target location
    First, put the gripper at the edge of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the edge of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the edge of the plate
    Next, push the plate backwards towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the edge of the plate, push the plate backwards towards the target location by moving the gripper while maintaining contact with the plate.
