To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly beside the puck  2. Push the puck towards the target location
    First, put the gripper beside the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not beside the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is beside the puck
    Once the gripper is beside the puck, push the puck towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is beside the puck, move the robot's gripper until the puck reaches the target location.
