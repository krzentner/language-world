To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Line up the peg with the hole
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole

More specifically, the following actions should be taken:

1. First, put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Next, grab the peg with the gripper.
- If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. Once the gripper is around the peg, line up the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.
- When the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg.

4. Finally, insert the peg into the hole by sliding it sideways.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole.
