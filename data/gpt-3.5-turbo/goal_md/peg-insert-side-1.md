To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Move gripper to the side of the hole  3. Lower the gripper to insert the peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg to avoid any collisions with the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Once the gripper is above the peg, move it to the side of the hole where the peg will be inserted.
    - When the robot's gripper is not located at the side of the hole, move the robot's gripper to the side of the hole
    Finally, lower the gripper to insert the peg into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the side of the hole and the robot's gripper is not inserted into the hole, lower the robot's gripper to insert the peg
