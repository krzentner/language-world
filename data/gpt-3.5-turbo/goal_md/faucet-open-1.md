To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper to the faucet handle  2. Close gripper around the handle  3. Turn the handle left 
    First, move the gripper close to the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is near the handle, close the gripper around the handle to get a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle
    Finally, turn the handle left to open the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle left until the faucet is open
