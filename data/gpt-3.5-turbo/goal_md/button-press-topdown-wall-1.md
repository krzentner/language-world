For the task `button-press-topdown-wall` requires the robot to push the button down from above with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above, on the side of the wall that allows access to the button
    We need to put the gripper in a position that allows us to reach the button while avoiding the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button and the button is behind the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the button on the side of the wall that allows access to the button.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the button, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button.
