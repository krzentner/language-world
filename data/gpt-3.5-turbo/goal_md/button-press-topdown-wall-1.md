To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper behind the wall and above the button  2. Adjust the gripper to be lined up with the button  3. Push down on the button from the top
    Because there is a short wall in the way, the robot should place the gripper behind the wall and move the gripper forward until it is above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not behind the wall and above the button, move the robot's gripper behind the wall and above the button
    Once the gripper is above the button, adjust the gripper to be lined up with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button and not horizontally aligned with it, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
