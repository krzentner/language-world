To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle from the side  3. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, we need to move the gripper around the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the side of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, we can push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle
