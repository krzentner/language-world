To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper next to handle  2. Push down on the handle from the side
First, line up the robot's gripper next to the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
Now that we have the gripper next to the handle, we can push down on it from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the handle and the robot's gripper is closed.
