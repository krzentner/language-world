To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    We need to position the gripper to the left of the window handle first.
    - When the robot's gripper is not left of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the window handle
    Once the gripper is positioned to the left of the window handle, we can start pushing against the window handle to close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is left of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
