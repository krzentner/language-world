I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here are the correct steps for sliding the window closed to the right:
 
The task `window-close` requires the robot to slide the window closed to the right.
To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, we can begin pushing the window closed by moving the gripper to the right.
    - When the robot's gripper is right of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle
