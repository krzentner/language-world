To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Move the cube sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube to prepare for grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until it is above the cube
    Next, grab the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the cube and the robot is ready to move it, move the cube sideways to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot has not yet moved the cube sideways to the target location, move the robot's gripper to slide the cube to the target location.
