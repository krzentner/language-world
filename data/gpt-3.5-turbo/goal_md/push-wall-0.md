To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck and check if the wall is in the way.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    - If the robot's gripper cannot reach the puck due to the wall being in the way, move the robot's base to an angle such that the wall is not obstructing the gripper.

2. Push the gripper into the top of the puck until the puck is clear of the wall. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck
    - If the puck is not clear of the wall, push the gripper into the top of the puck and move the gripper towards the target location until the puck is clear of the wall.

3. Once the puck is clear of the wall, slide the puck towards the target location.
    - If the puck is already towards the target location, slide it to the target location.
    - Otherwise, if the puck is closer to the wall, move the gripper towards the target location until the puck is clear of the wall and slide it to the target location.
