To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Move gripper near the wall, where it can sense the location of the target
2. Move arm to reach above the wall while keeping the gripper open
3. Close the gripper around the target
4. Move the gripper and the target back down below the wall
5. Move the gripper to the target location

Since there is a short wall in the way, the robot needs to first move the gripper near the wall where it can still sense the location of the target. Once the gripper is near the wall, the robot should move its arm to reach above the wall while keeping the gripper open.

When the robot's gripper is above the target without touching the wall, it can close the gripper around the target and move the gripper and the target back down below the wall to avoid hitting the wall. Finally, the robot should move the gripper to the target location to complete the task.
