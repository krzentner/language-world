The robot should perform the following steps to pull the door open reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull the door open
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction since the door is usually large and we're just pulling it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    If the gripper is not around the door handle, put it around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, move the robot's gripper until the door is fully open.
