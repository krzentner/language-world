To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper around the handle of the mug 
2. Lift the mug 
3. Move the mug to the target location 
4. Lower the mug 

First, the gripper should be placed around the handle of the mug. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle 

After securing the mug, lift it up. 
- When the mug is not in the air, lift the mug up using the gripper 

Now that the mug is lifted, move it to the target location. 
- When the mug is not at the target location, move the mug to the target location 

Finally, lower the mug onto the target location. 
- When the mug is not lowered onto the target location, lower the mug onto the target location using the gripper
