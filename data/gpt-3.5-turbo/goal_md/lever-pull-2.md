To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever  2. Pull the lever up
    First, put the gripper around the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the lever and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is not around the lever, grab the lever by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever
    Once the gripper is above the lever, pull the lever up to complete the task.
