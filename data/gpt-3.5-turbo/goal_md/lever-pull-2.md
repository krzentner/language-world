The robot should perform the following steps to rotate the lever up reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around lever handle  2. Pull the lever up
    First, put the gripper around the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever handle
    Once the gripper is around the lever handle, we can just pull the lever up by moving the gripper up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lever handle
