The steps the robot should perform to pull the drawer open reliably are:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle: The robot needs to put the gripper above the drawer handle before it can grab and pull it. The robot should move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle: Once the gripper is above the drawer handle, the robot should move the gripper down until it is around the handle.
3. Pull open the drawer: Once the gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull the drawer open. If the drawer is difficult to open, the robot may need to apply more force by increasing the grip strength on the handle or pulling with more force. 

Once the robot has successfully opened the drawer, it may need to move its gripper back to its original location if this is required for the task.
