The robot should perform the following steps to complete the `sweep-into` task:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Align the cube with the target location  4. Move the cube to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube
    Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the cube, close the gripper to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the cube, align it with the target location.
    - When the cube is not aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the cube is aligned with the target location
    Finally, move the gripper and cube to the target location.
    - When the cube is aligned with the target location and the gripper is not above it, move the gripper and cube to the target location.
