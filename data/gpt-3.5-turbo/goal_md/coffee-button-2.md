To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Move the robot's gripper near the button on the coffee machine
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the coffee machine button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the coffee machine button
2. Line up the gripper with the button on the coffee machine
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button on the coffee machine, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the button on the coffee machine
3. Push down on the button to activate the coffee machine
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the button on the coffee machine, move the robot's gripper down until the robot's gripper presses the button. Once pressed, hold the button down until the coffee machine has finished brewing.
