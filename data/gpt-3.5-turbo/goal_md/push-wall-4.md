To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck 2. Push gripper into top of puck 3. Slide puck to wall 4. Lift the puck slightly 5. Slide puck past the wall to the target location

Similar to the `push` task, first put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
Push the gripper against the top of the puck to trap it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper down until the gripper is pushing down on the top of the puck
Slide the puck towards the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is pushing down on the puck, move the robot's gripper until it is near the wall
Lift the puck slightly to clear the wall and keep pushing it towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wall, lift the puck slightly and then move the robot's gripper past the wall to slide the puck to the target location.
