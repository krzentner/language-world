Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:

1. Put the gripper to the left of the window handle. 
2. If the gripper is not near the window handle, move the gripper near it until the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle. 
3. If the gripper is near the window handle, move the gripper so that the gripper is forward aligned with the window handle. 
4. If the window handle is right of the gripper and the gripper is not near the window handle, move the gripper until it is near the handle. 
5. Once the gripper is near the handle, push against the handle to close the window. 
6. If the window is not fully closed yet, push harder until the window is completely closed.
