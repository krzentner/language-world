First, put the gripper above the ball.
  - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball
If the ball is not in the gripper, grab it with the gripper.
  - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
Move the gripper close to the hoop, so the robot is in position to aim.
  - When the robot's gripper is near the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the hoop
Lift the gripper high up so that the ball can be aimed at the hoop.
  - When the robot's gripper is close to the hoop and the robot's gripper is holding the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is high up
Aim at the hoop while holding the ball.
  - When the robot's gripper is high up and the robot's gripper is holding the ball, move the robot's gripper until the ball is above the center of the hoop
Finally, release the ball into the hoop.
  - When the ball is above the center of the hoop, release the ball from the gripper and let it fall into the hoop.
