To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Grab the mug with the gripper  3. Lift the mug off the table  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Release the mug at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the mug roughly aligned with the center of the top of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the center of the top of the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the center of the top of the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up with the center of the top of the mug, close the gripper around the mug by moving the gripper down.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the center of the top of the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now we can lift the mug off the table by moving the gripper upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug and the mug is still on the table, move the robot's gripper until the mug is lifted off the table
    Once we have lifted the mug off the table, we can move it to the target location.
    - When the mug is not at target location, move the robot's gripper until the mug is at the target location
    Finally, release the mug at the target location by opening the gripper.
    - When the mug is at the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open and is no longer holding the mug.
