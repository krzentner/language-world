To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the cube  2. Close the gripper around the cube  3. Lift the cube off the ground  4. Move the gripper sideways to the target location  5. Place the cube down at the target location
    First, put the gripper near the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube
    If the gripper is not around the cube, close it around the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot' gripper is closed
    Lift the cube up to ensure we don't drag it on the ground while moving sideways.
    - When the cube is around 2 cm above the ground, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Move the cube sideways to the target location while keeping the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not near the ground, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Place the cube down at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around 2 cm above the ground and the robot's gripper is release the cube.
