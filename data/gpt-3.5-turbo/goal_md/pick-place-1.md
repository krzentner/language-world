To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab puck with gripper  3. Move gripper towards target location  4. Release puck at target location
    First, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    Once the gripper is aligned with the puck, grab the puck by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck
    After grabbing the puck, move the gripper towards the target location while holding onto the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
    Finally, release the puck at the target location by opening the gripper.
