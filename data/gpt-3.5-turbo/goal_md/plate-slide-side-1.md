To slide the plate sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Grab the plate with the gripper
3. Move the gripper to the left or right of the plate, depending on the direction in which it needs to be slid
4. Move the gripper with the plate towards the target location
5. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
6. Release the plate from the gripper

So the detailed steps are as follows:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
- If the plate is not aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper towards the target location
- If the robot's gripper is not left or right of the plate, move the robot's gripper either to the left or right of the plate, depending on the direction in which it needs to be slid
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
- If the plate is not slightly touching the target location but not inside it, move the robot's gripper and plate sideways into the target location
- When the plate is in the target location, release the plate from the gripper by opening the gripper.
