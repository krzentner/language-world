To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Move gripper down around the plate  3. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate so that we can grab it without bumping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the gripper is above the plate, move it down around the plate to grab it from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    If the gripper is not at the target location, slide the plate sideways towards it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location
