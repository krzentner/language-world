The task of `door-unlock` requires the robot to turn the dial on the door. To unlock the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
  1. Put gripper around the dial handle
  2. Turn the dial in the clockwise direction until it stops
  3. Turn the handle to open the door

First, put the gripper around the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the dial handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the dial handle
Once the gripper is around the dial handle, turn the dial in the clockwise direction until it stops.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial handle and the dial is not fully turned in the clockwise direction, rotate the dial handle until the dial stops turning
Now the door should be unlocked. Turn the handle to open the door.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
- When the robot's gripper is near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
- Turn the handle to open the door.
