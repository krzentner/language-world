The task `door-unlock` requires the robot to turn the dial on the door. To do this reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the gripper near the dial
2. Determine the correct direction to turn the dial
3. Turn the dial in the correct direction until it stops

First, position the gripper near the dial. The gripper should be able to wrap around the dial and grip it firmly.

- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial.

Next, determine the correct direction to turn the dial. This may require some prior knowledge or instructions on which way to turn the dial in order to unlock the door.

- Depending on the door lock mechanism, the robot should determine the correct direction to turn the dial.

Finally, turn the dial in the correct direction until it stops. The robot should turn the dial slowly and stop when it feels resistance, indicating that the lock has been successfully opened.

- When the robot is turning the dial, it should do so slowly and stop when it encounters resistance. Once the lock has been successfully opened, the robot should stop turning the dial.
