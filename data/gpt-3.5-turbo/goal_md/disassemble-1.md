To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Position the gripper above the wrench on the peg
            2. Close the gripper around the wrench
            3. Lift the wrench off the peg
    First, position the gripper above the wrench on the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench on the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench on the peg
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench on the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the wrench on the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the wrench, we can lift it off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper up until the wrench is lifted off the peg
