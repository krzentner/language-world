To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Grab the wrench handle with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the wrench handle, we can grab the wrench handle by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that we are gripping the wrench handle, we can lift it off the peg by moving the gripper upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the wrench handle is lifted off the peg
