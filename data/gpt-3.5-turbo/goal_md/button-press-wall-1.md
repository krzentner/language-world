To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper near the wall until the gripper is above the button  2. Push forward on the button
    Since there is a wall in the way, the robot needs to move its gripper to the edge of the wall to avoid hitting it. Move the gripper to the edge of the wall until it is right above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wall and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed and the robot's gripper is near the wall
    Once the gripper is above the button and near the wall, simply push forward on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is above the button, move the robot's gripper until the button has been fully pressed
