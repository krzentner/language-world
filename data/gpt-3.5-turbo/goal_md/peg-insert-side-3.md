To insert the peg into the hole from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg.

2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed.

3. Line up the peg with the hole.
- When the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the hole.

4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole.
- While holding the peg above the hole, move the robot's gripper sideways until the peg slides into the hole.
