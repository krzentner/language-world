To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Move gripper to the side of the hole  3. Drop gripper around the peg  4. Close gripper to grab the peg  5. Insert the peg into the hole
    First, put the gripper roughly above the peg so we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Next, move the gripper to the side of the hole to prepare for inserting the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the side of the hole
    Drop the gripper around the peg and close it to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the side of the hole and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    Finally, insert the peg straight into the hole from the side.
    - When the gripper is around the peg and aligned with the hole, insert it into the hole straight.
