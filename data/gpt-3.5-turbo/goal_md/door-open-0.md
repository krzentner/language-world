The robot should perform the following steps to pull the door open reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around door handle  2. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the door handle
