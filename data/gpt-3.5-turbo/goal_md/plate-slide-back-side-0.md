To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper mostly around plate from the side  2. Slide gripper sideways to move the plate back
    First, put the gripper mostly around the plate from the side, so that we can grip it and slide it easily to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not mostly around the plate from the side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is mostly around the plate from the side
    Once the gripper is mostly around the plate from the side, use the gripper to slide the plate sideways until the plate is in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is mostly around the plate from the side, move the robot's gripper sideways until the plate is in the target location.
