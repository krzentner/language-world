To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg hole  2. Drop gripper into the hole  3. Close gripper around the peg  4. Lift the peg out of the hole  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Release the peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg hole
    Once the gripper is above the peg hole, drop it into the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg hole and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is inside the hole and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper now has a hold on the peg, lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is inside the hole and the gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is above the target location
    Move the peg to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed, release the peg.
