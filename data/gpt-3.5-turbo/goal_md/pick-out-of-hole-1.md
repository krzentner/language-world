The robot should perform the following steps to pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably:
1. Put gripper above the hole
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
2. Move gripper down into the hole and open the gripper to surround the peg
    - When the robot's gripper is not in the hole and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in the hole and the robot's gripper is open
3. Close the gripper around the peg
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, close the robot's gripper around the peg
4. Lift the peg out of the hole
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the peg, lift the peg out of the hole
5. Move the gripper to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location.
