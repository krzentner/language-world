We will assume that the robot can pick up the basketball using the gripper and has to place it into the hoop located at a certain height.
The robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the basketball  2. Grab the basketball using the gripper  3. Bring the basketball near the hoop  4. Lift the gripper to the height of the hoop  5. Move the gripper towards the hoop  6. Release the basketball in a controlled manner into the hoop
First, put the gripper above the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the basketball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the basketball
If the basketball is not attached to the gripper, we need to use the gripper to grab the basketball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the basketball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the basketball and the robot's gripper is closed   
Once the robot has the basketball, we need to bring it near the basketball hoop.
    - When the gripper is not near the basketball hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the basketball hoop
Lift the gripper to the height of the basketball hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the height of the basketball hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the height of the basketball hoop
Once we have moved the gripper to the correct height, we can move the gripper towards the basketball hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the basketball hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is aligned with the basketball hoop
Finally, we can release the basketball in a controlled manner into the hoop.
    - Open the gripper to release the basketball into the hoop in a controlled manner.
