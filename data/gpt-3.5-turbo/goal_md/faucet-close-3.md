To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the faucet handle  2. Turn the handle to the right to close the faucet
    First, move the gripper to the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle
    Once the gripper is on the handle, turn the handle to the right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, turn the handle to the right
