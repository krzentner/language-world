The robot should perform the following steps to push the drawer close reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer edge  2. Push the drawer closed
    First, we need to put the gripper above the edge of the drawer.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer edge, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer edge
    Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer edge, we can push the drawer closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer edge, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is somewhat above the drawer
