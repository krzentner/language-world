I think you may have made a small error in your task list, as `hand-insert` probably refers to inserting the puck into a hole rather than just moving it to a target location. However, I can provide steps for picking up the puck and moving it to a target location. 

Steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move puck to target location

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck

If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.

- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed

If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.

- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the puck is at the target location.
