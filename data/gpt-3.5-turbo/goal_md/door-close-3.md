To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly in the middle of the door  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door, move it to the middle of the door. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door
    If the gripper is roughly in the middle of the door, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is roughly in the middle of the door, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle if there is one, or roughly in the middle of the door if there isn't a handle.
