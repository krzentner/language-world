To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot.
2. Drop gripper around the puck and close gripper around puck.
3. Lift the gripper and puck up and over the wall.
4. Move the gripper and puck to the target location.
5. Lower the gripper and puck to the target location.

If the gripper is not above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot, move it until it is.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot

Once the gripper is above the puck on the same side as the robot, drop the gripper around the puck and close it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot and the gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck on the same side of the wall as the robot and close the gripper around the puck

Next, the gripper and puck need to be lifted up and over the wall. 
- When the gripper and puck are not above the wall, move the gripper and puck until they are above the wall.

After lifting the gripper and puck over the wall, move them to the target location.
- When the gripper and puck are not at the target location, move the gripper and puck until they are at the target location.

Finally, lower the gripper and puck to the target location.
- When the gripper and puck are above the target location, lower the gripper and puck until they are at the target location.
