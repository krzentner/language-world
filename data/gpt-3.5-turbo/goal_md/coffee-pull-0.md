To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper around mug handle  2. Pick up the mug by lifting gripper  3. Move the mug towards the target location by sliding it on the surface  4. Put the mug down at the target location

First, put the gripper around the mug handle, making sure that the gripper has a good grip on the mug and it won't slip.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed

Once the gripper is securely holding the mug, lift the gripper to pick up the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is lifted and the mug is off the ground

Now that the robot is holding the mug, it can slide the mug towards the target location.
- When the mug is not at the target location, move the mug until it is near the target location by sliding the gripper on the surface

Finally, the robot can put the mug down at the target location.
- When the mug is near the target location, move the mug until the mug is at the target location by putting the mug down.
