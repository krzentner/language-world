To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug handle  2. Drop gripper around the mug handle  3. Grab the mug by closing the gripper around it  4. Lift up the mug  5. Move the mug to the target location  6. Lower the mug onto the target location
    Start by positioning the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle
    Once the gripper is positioned above the handle, drop the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    With the gripper around the handle, close the gripper to grab the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is closed
    Lift up the mug so that it can be moved to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, move the robot's gripper to the target location while the gripper is still holding the mug
    Finally, lower the mug onto the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is not touching the target location, move the robot's gripper down to lower the mug onto the target location.
