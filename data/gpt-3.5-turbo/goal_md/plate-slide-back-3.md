To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate handle area  2. Push the plate back into the target location
    The robot can slide the plate by trapping it between the gripper and the target location. If the handle area of the plate is not below the gripper, move the gripper above the handle area
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the plate handle area, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the plate handle area and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the handle area of the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it back to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate handle area, move the robot's gripper until the plate is back to the target location
