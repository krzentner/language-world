To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle upwards while keeping the gripper closed
    First, put the gripper near the handle. We don't need to be precise about the position.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    Once the gripper is near the handle, grab the handle with the gripper and close it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is not closed, close the robot's gripper
    Now that the gripper is holding the handle, pull it upwards to lift the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is in the desired position
