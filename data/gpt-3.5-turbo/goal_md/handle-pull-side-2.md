To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull up on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull up on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
