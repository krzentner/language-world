Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window open to the left reliably:

1. Put the gripper right of the window handle.
2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
3. Push the window open harder.

If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, it should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
4. When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle.
If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, it can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left.
5. When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle.
