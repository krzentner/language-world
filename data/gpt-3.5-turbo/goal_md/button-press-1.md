To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push gripper into the button  3. Press the button down
    First, move the gripper in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button
    If the gripper is slightly above or to the side of the button, push it into the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not pushing into the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pushing into the button
    Once the gripper is pressing into the button, we can simply press the button down.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing into the button, press the button down
