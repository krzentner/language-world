To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Position the robot's gripper in front of the button and above the wall
           2. Open the gripper
           3. Move the gripper down until it is below the wall and close to the button
           4. Close the gripper around the button
           5. Push the button by moving the gripper towards the wall

First, position the robot's gripper in front of the button and above the wall, so that we can see the button and reach it with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not in front of the button and above the wall, move the robot's gripper until it is in front of the button and above the wall

Then, open the gripper so that it can grab the button.
- When the robot's gripper is not open, open the gripper

Move the gripper down until it is below the wall and close to the button, so that we can grab the button.
- When the robot's gripper is not close to the button and below the wall, move the gripper down until it is below the wall and close to the button

Close the gripper around the button to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not closed around the button, close the gripper around the button

Finally, push the button by moving the gripper towards the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not pushing the button towards the wall, move the gripper towards the wall to push the button
