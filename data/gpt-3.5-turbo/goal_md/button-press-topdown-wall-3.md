To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the button from above  2. Move the robot's gripper forward, cupping it around the wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    Because there is a short wall in the way, the robot needs to move its gripper forward and cup it around the wall to be able to push the button down. Line up the robot's gripper with the button from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    With the gripper lined up, move the robot's gripper forward so that it cups around the wall but still contacts the surface below the button.
     - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper forward until it cups around the wall and contacts the surface below the button
    Once the gripper cups around the wall, push down on the button as before.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is closed
