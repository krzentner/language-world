To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the button  2. Push the button
    First, put the gripper above the button
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is above the button and closed, we can push down on the button to make the coffee
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is closed, push the button down.
