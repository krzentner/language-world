To pull up the handle reliably in the `handle-pull` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around the handle  3. Grip the handle firmly  4. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is vertically lined up, drop the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, grip the handle firmly by closing the gripper more.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is not firmly gripping the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper has firmly gripped the handle
    Now that the gripper is securely holding the handle, pull the handle up to complete the task.
    - When the robot's gripper is firmly gripping the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper has pulled the handle up completely.
