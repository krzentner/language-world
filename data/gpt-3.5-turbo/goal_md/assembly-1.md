The task `assembly` requires the robot to grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg. To complete this task reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the wrench.
2. Close the gripper around the center of the wrench.
3. Move the gripper to the peg.
4. Align the wrench with the peg.
5. Rotate the gripper to wrap the wrench around the peg.

First, put the gripper above the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wrench

Grab the wrench by closing the gripper around the center of the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the center of the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed

Next, move the gripper to the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg

Align the wrench with the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg but not aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is aligned with the peg

Wrap the wrench around the peg by rotating the gripper.
- When the wrench is aligned with the peg, rotate the robot's gripper until the wrench is wrapped around the peg.
