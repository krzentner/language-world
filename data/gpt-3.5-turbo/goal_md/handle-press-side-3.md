To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper near the handle, to the side of it  2. Move the gripper towards the handle until the gripper is around it  3. Push down on the handle from the side
First, put the gripper near the handle, to the side of it.
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the gripper towards the handle until the gripper is around it.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper towards the handle until the robot's gripper is around the handle 
Now that the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle from the side
