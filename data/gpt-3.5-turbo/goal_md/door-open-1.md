The robot should perform the following steps to pull the door open:
1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
2. When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is closed.
3. As long as the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
4. When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is left of the door handle.
