To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Place the end of the stick near the thermos  4. Push the thermos to the target location with the stick
    First, put the gripper above the stick, making sure the gripper is vertically aligned with the stick from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the stick, close the gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed
    Place the end of the stick near the thermos and push it towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, move the end of the stick towards the thermos
    - When the end of the stick is near the thermos, move the end of the stick towards the target location, pushing the thermos along the way
