To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the drawer handle  2. Pull the drawer open
    First, put the gripper around the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is tightly around the handle, we can try pulling the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the drawer is fully open
