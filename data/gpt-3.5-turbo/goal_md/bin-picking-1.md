To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Locate the cube and determine its position and orientation
2. Position the gripper above the cube
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
3. Lower the gripper onto the cube and close the gripper
   - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
4. Lift the cube and move it towards the target bin
   - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, lift the cube by moving the robot's gripper up
   - When the cube is positioned above the target bin, move the gripper towards the bin
5. Release the cube into the target bin
   - When the robot's gripper is above the bin, open the gripper to release the cube into the bin.
