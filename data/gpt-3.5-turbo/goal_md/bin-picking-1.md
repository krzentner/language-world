To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Scan the workspace to locate the cube and target bin  2. Move the gripper above the cube  3. Lower the gripper and close it to grab the cube  4. Lift the gripper and move it towards the target bin  5. Lower the gripper and open it to release the cube into the target bin

    First, scan the workspace to locate the cube and target bin using sensors or vision tools.
    - When the cube and target bin are not detected, move the gripper to a default position and restart the scanning of the workspace.
    Once the cube is located, move the gripper above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Lower the gripper and close it to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Lift the gripper and move it towards the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
    Lower the gripper and open it to release the cube into the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target bin and the robot's gripper is open
