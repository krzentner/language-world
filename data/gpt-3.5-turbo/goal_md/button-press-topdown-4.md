    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Move gripper down to touch button surface  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the gripper approximately above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the button
    If the gripper is not touching the button, move it down until it touches the surface of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the button surface
    Once the gripper is touching the button surface, push down on the button to press it.
