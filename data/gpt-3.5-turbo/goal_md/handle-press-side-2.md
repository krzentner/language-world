To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper to the side of the handle  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the handle from the side, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper so it is pushing down on the handle
