To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push the button
    First, put the gripper in front of the button so that we can push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in front of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the button
    Once the gripper is in front of the button, we can just push the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is in front of the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button.
