The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front.
To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper in front of the button  2. Push the button
    Because this is not "topdown", we just need to put the gripper in front of the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is lined up in front of the button, just push the button. 
    - When the robot's gripper is almost horizontally aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button.
