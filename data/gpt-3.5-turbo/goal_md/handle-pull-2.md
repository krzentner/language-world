The steps the robot should perform to pull up the handle reliably are:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper below the handle  2. Close gripper around the handle  3. Pull up the handle
    First, put the robot's gripper below the handle to prepare for grasping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not below the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is below the handle
    Once the gripper is below the handle, close the gripper around the handle to ensure a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is below the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Finally, pull up the handle while maintaining a good grip.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pulled up to the desired position.
