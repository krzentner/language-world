The following steps could be taken to pull up the handle reliably:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the handle  2. Grip the handle and pull upwards
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the handle and aligned with it, grip the handle and pull it upwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper upwards while keeping hold of the handle
