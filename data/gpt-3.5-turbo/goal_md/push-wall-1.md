To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck on opposite side of the wall  2. Push gripper into top of puck to move the puck towards the wall  3. Move gripper above wall while trapping the puck  4. Slide the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck on the side opposite to the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the opposite side of the wall as the puck, move the robot's gripper until it is on the opposite side of the wall as the puck
    Push the gripper into the top of the puck to move it towards the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, push the gripper into the top of the puck
    Move the gripper above the wall while trapping the puck.
    - When the puck is against the wall and the robot's gripper is gripping the puck, move the robot's gripper above the wall, trapping the puck in the gripper
    Slide the puck to the target location using the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper over the target location and release the puck
