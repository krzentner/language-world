To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Move the gripper to align with the opening in the small wall
4. Slide the puck through the opening and towards the target location
5. Once the puck is on the other side of the wall, move the gripper to align with the puck
6. If the gripper is not near the puck, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it forward
7. When the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the gripper, move the gripper until the gripper is above the target location.
