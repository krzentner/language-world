To push the soccer ball into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Push gripper into the soccer ball  3. Roll the soccer ball towards the target location
    The robot can push the soccer ball by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the ball isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball
    If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, move the gripper down to the soccer ball to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can roll it towards the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the soccer ball is pushed and rolled towards the target location
