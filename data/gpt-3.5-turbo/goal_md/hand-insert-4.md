The task `hand-insert` requires the robot to pick up the puck and move it to the target location with the gripper in a horizontal position.
To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Line up the gripper with the target location  4. Move the gripper to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, the robot can lift the puck up and move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location
    Finally, move the gripper to the target location by keeping it in a horizontal position.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location.
