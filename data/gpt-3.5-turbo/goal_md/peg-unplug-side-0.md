To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Push the peg out of the hole from the side
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    If the gripper is not around the peg, put the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the peg, push the peg out from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is to the side of the hole and the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg. Then release the peg.
