To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near puck  2. Push the puck towards the target location
    First, put the gripper near the puck, so that we can start pushing it towards the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck
    Next, start pushing the puck towards the target location.
    - When the puck is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while maintaining contact with the puck until the puck reaches the target location.
