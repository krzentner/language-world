To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck. 2. Push gripper into top of puck. 3. Slide puck away from the goal. 4. Slide the puck towards the target location.
    The robot can slide the puck by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably trapped the puck and can slide it backwards away from the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is opposite to the target location. While doing that, slide the puck away from the goal.
    If the puck has been slide away from the goal and the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location, slide the puck towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper towards the target location while sliding the puck towards the target location.
