To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Position the gripper above the hoop  4. Release the ball from the gripper into the hoop
    First, position the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball
    Once the gripper is lined up with the ball, grasp it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball and robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the ball and robot's gripper is closed
    Position the gripper above the hoop.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hoop
