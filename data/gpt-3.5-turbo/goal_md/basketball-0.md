To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Approach the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Drive towards the hoop  4. Raise the gripper to lift the ball  5. Align the ball with the hoop  6. Release the ball into the hoop
First, approach the ball and grab it with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the ball and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the robot has the ball, it should drive towards the hoop.
- When the robot is not aligned with the hoop, move the robot until it's close to the hoop
Once the robot is close to the hoop, it should raise the gripper to lift the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hoop
The robot should then align the ball with the hoop before releasing it.
- When the ball is not aligned with the hoop, move the robot's gripper until the ball is aligned with the hoop
Finally, the robot should release the ball into the hoop by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is closed and the ball is aligned with the hoop, open the robot's gripper to release the ball into the hoop.
