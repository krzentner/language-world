To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Locate the cube using sensors  2. Position the gripper above the cube  3. Drop the gripper around the cube and close it to grab the cube  4. Lift the cube up and move it to the target bin  5. Position the gripper above the target bin  6. Open the gripper to drop the cube into the target bin
    First, use sensors to locate the cube and determine its position.
    - When the cube is not located, search for it until it is found
    Once the cube is located, position the gripper above it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
    Drop the gripper around the cube and close it to grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
    Lift the cube up and move it to the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, lift the cube up and move it to the target bin
    Position the gripper above the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
    Open the gripper to drop the cube into the target bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, open the gripper to drop the cube into the target bin.
