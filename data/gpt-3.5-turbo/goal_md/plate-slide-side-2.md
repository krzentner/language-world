To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Slide the plate sideways to target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once gripper is above the plate, drop it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    Now, slide the plate to the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is open.
