To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Rotate the gripper to be above the stick and drop the gripper around the stick
2. Close the gripper around the stick
3. Move the robot's gripper (with the stick) to the thermos handle
4. Drop the stick around the thermos handle
5. Move the robot's gripper (with the thermos and stick) towards the target location
6. Pull the thermos using the stick until it reaches the target location

First, rotate the gripper above the stick and drop the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick and the gripper is open, rotate the gripper until it is above the stick and then move the robot's gripper until the gripper is around the stick and the gripper is closed

Once the gripper is around the stick, move the robot's gripper with the stick to the thermos handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper with the stick until it is near the thermos handle

Once the robot's gripper is near the thermos handle, drop the stick around the thermos handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the thermos handle and the robot's gripper is closed around the stick, drop the stick around the thermos handle

Now that the stick is around the thermos handle, move the robot's gripper (with the thermos and stick) towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper (with the thermos and stick) towards the target location

Finally, use the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location until it reaches the target location.
- While the thermos is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper (with the thermos and stick) towards the target location and use the stick to pull the thermos until it reaches the target location.
