To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the hammer with the nail  2. Swing the hammer to hit the nail
    First, line up the hammer with the nail by placing it above the nail head.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the nail head, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the nail head and the robot's gripper is closed, holding the hammer
    Once the hammer is lined up above the nail head, we can swing the hammer to strike the nail.
    - Swing the hammer down to hit the nail head. The robot should adjust the trajectory of the hammer if needed, ensuring that it hits the nail squarely and with sufficient force.
