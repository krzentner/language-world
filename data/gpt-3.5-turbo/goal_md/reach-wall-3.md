To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper above the wall  2. Move gripper over the wall to the target location
    First, move the gripper above the wall to get a better view of the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Once the gripper is above the wall, move the gripper over the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall but not at the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the target location. If necessary, make sure to avoid hitting the wall on the way over.
