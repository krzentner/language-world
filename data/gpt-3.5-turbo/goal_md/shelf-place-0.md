To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Lift the block off the shelf  4. Move the block towards the target location  5. Release the block above the target location
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block
    If the gripper is not around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the block and the gripper is closed, lift the block off the shelf.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the block and the grip is closed, move the robot's gripper up until the block is clear of the shelf
    Once the block is clear of the shelf, move it towards the target location and line it up.
    - When the block is not over target location, move the robot's gripper until the block is over the target location
    Finally, release the block above the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is over target location and the grip is closed, release the block by opening the gripper
