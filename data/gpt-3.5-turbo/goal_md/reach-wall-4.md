To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Determine a path that will avoid the wall to get to the target location.
2. Move the robot's gripper to the starting point of the path.
3. Move the gripper along the path to the target location.
4. If the gripper cannot reach the target location directly, adjust the path and try again until the target location can be reached without hitting the wall.
5. When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, repeat steps 3-4 until the gripper is at the target location. 

Note: The exact method of avoiding the wall and determining the path may depend on the specifics of the task and the robot's capabilities.
