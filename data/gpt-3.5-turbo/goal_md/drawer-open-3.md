The robot should perform the following steps to reliably pull the drawer open:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the drawer handle  2. Pull the drawer open
    First, put the gripper roughly around the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle
    If the drawer is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can pull the drawer open.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle.
