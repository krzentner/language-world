To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial to lock or unlock the door
    First, put the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial
    If the dial is not yet in the gripper, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is closed around the dial
    If the dial is not yet in the desired locked or unlocked position, turn the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the dial, turn the dial until the door is locked or unlocked.
