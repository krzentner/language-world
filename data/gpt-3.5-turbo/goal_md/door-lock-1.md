To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Align the gripper with the dial
We need to align the gripper with the dial to ensure that we can turn it. Move the robot's gripper until it is near the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not in front of the dial, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is in front of the dial

2. Grab the dial
We need to grab the dial to turn it. Move the robot's gripper until it is around the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, move the robot's gripper until it is around the dial

3. Turn the dial to the correct combination
We need to turn the dial to the correct combination to unlock the door. Use the gripper to turn the dial, following the correct sequence of numbers for the combination.
- When robot's gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the first number of the combination
- When robot's gripper is around the dial and the first number of the combination is set, turn the dial to the second number of the combination
- Repeat this step for all the remaining numbers of the combination, until the lock is unlocked

4. Release the dial
Once the correct combination is set and the door is unlocked, release the dial by opening the gripper.
- When the dial reaches the correct combination, open the gripper to release the dial

5. Move the gripper away from the door handle
To complete the task, move the gripper away from the door handle.
- When the gripper is released, move the robot's gripper until it is away from the door handle.
