The steps the robot should perform to push down the handle reliably are:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper down around the handle  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is lined up above the handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can push down on the handle to perform the task.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pressed down.
