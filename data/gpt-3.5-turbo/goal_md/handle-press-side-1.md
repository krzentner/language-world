To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle from the side.
