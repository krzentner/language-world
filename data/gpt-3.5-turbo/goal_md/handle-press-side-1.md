To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put gripper next to the handle  2. Push the handle down
    First, put the gripper roughly next to the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle
    Now that the gripper is roughly next to the handle, push it down.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the handle and the robot's gripper is closed.
