The following steps should be performed by the robot to push down the handle reliably:
    Steps:  1. Align the gripper with the handle  2. Push the handle down
    First, the gripper needs to be aligned with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is aligned with the handle, we can just push the handle down.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
