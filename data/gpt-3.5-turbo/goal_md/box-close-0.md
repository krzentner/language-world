- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the box lid, move the gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
Once the gripper is above the box, gently lower the box lid onto the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is not touching the box, move the robot's gripper until the box lid touches the box
