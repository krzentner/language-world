To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above lid
       2. Drop gripper around lid
       3. Close gripper around lid
       4. Move gripper above box
       5. Open gripper to release lid onto box

First, put the gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the lid
Once the gripper is above the lid, we should be able to grab it by moving the gripper down and closing it around the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the lid and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper above the box
Once the gripper is above the box, we can release the lid by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
