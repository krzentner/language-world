To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench up off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench handle
    Once the gripper is lined up with the wrench handle, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is holding the wrench, lift the wrench up off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle and the wrench is still on the peg, move the robot's gripper upwards until the wrench is lifted off the peg
