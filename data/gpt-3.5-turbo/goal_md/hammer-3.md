To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Pick up the hammer with the gripper  2. Line up the hammer with the nail  3. Hit the nail with the hammer
    First, put the gripper around the hammer handle and close the gripper to hold it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the robot has hold of the hammer, we need to line up the hammer with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the hammer head, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the hammer head
    If the hammer is aligned with the nail and there is space to swing the hammer, hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the hammer head and the hammer is forward aligned with the nail, move the hammer until the hammer is above the nail and swing the hammer down to hit the nail.
