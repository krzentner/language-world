To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck to a location just above the wall  5. Move gripper over the wall to reach the target location  6. Move puck down to the target location
First, the robot needs to put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
Once the gripper is above the puck, the robot needs to drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
With the gripper closed around the puck, the robot needs to move the puck to a location just above the wall, so it can prepare to move over the wall to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around puck and the puck is not vertically aligned with the wall, move the robot's gripper until the puck is just above the wall
After the puck is lifted just above the wall, the robot needs to move the gripper over the wall to reach the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is just above the wall, move the robot's gripper to reach the target location
Finally, the robot can move the puck down to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the puck is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper down until the puck is at the target location.
