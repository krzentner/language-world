To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the stick handle  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Put the end of the stick against the thermos  4. Pull the thermos towards the goal
First, put the robot's gripper roughly around the handle of the stick near the part where the stick is likely to be attached to the thermos. 
- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick handle
Close the gripper around the stick handle to grip the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the stick handle
Place the end of the stick against the thermos so that we can apply a force to move the thermos.
- When the end of the stick is not against the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the end of the stick is against the thermos
Pull the thermos towards the target location by manipulating the stick.
- When the end of the stick is against the thermos, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
