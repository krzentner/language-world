The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific position.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, turn the dial to the desired position
