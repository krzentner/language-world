To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper's left finger on the left side of the plate  2. Put gripper's right finger on the right side of the plate  3. Slightly lift the plate off the surface  4. Move the gripper and plate to the target location  5. Lower the plate onto the surface at the target location
    First, position the robot's left finger of the gripper on the left side of the plate and position the robot's right finger of the gripper on the right side of the plate.
    - When the robot's left finger is not at the left side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the left finger is at the left side of the plate
    - When the robot's right finger is not at the right side of the plate, move the robot's gripper until the right finger is at the right side of the plate
    Slightly lift the plate off the surface to avoid any friction that may prevent sliding the plate.
    - When the plate is not lifted from the surface, slightly lift the plate off the surface
    Move the gripper and the plate to the target location while keeping the plate stable between the gripper fingers.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, move the gripper and the plate to the target location
    Lower the plate onto the surface at the target location while keeping the gripper fingers in contact with the plate.
    - When the plate is not on the surface at the target location, lower the plate onto the surface at the target location
