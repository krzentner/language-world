To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:

1. Put gripper above the stick
2. Drop gripper around the stick
3. Close gripper around the stick
4. Line the stick up with the thermos
5. Push the thermos to the target location using the stick

First, put the gripper roughly above the stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the stick

If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is closed

If the stick isn't lined up with the thermos, move the gripper/robot until the stick is in line with the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, move the robot's gripper until it is vertically aligned with the stick 
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and not near the thermos, move the robot's gripper until it's near the thermos

Once the stick is lined up with the thermos, use the stick to push the thermos to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the thermos, move the stick with the gripper until the thermos is at the target location.
