To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper and plate to the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the gripper isn't around plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is roughly above the target location
    Once the gripper is above the target location and holding the plate, slide the plate sideways into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the plate is not in the target location, move the gripper and plate until the plate is fully in the target location.
