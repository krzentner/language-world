    Steps:  1. Put gripper around side of the wall near button  2. Line up the gripper with the button  3. Push down on the button
    First, put the gripper around the side of the wall closest to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the side of the wall closest to the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the side of the wall closest to the button
    Once the gripper is around the side of the wall closest to the button, line up the robot's gripper with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
