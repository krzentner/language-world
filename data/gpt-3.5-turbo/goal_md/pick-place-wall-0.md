To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Turn the gripper sideways to grab the puck from the side  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Lift the gripper above the wall  6. Move the gripper to the goal location  7. Lower the gripper to place the puck at goal location

The first step is to put the gripper above the puck, just as in the pick-place task without a wall. We still need to grab the puck from the side because of the wall, so we need to turn the gripper sideways.
- When the robot's gripper is not sideways and the robot's gripper is above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is sideways
Once the gripper is sideways, we can drop it around the puck and close it to grab it. 
- When the robot's gripper is not almost completely around the puck and the robot's gripper is sideways, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost completely around the puck and close the gripper around the puck
The gripper holding the puck will be above the wall, so we need to lift the gripper up before moving it to the goal location. 
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
After moving to the goal location, we need to lower the gripper to place the puck at the goal location. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the goal location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the goal location and lower the gripper to place the puck at the goal location.
