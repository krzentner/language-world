The robot should perform the following steps to slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way:
    Steps:  1. Line up gripper above puck  2. Push the gripper into top of puck  3. Move the gripper towards the wall until it gently bumps into the wall  4. Slide the puck to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck and trap it by pushing down on it from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck
    As there is a wall in the way, the gripper needs to be moved carefully towards the wall and gently bumped into it, while keeping the puck trapped. Stop moving the gripper when it gently touches the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not touching the wall and the puck is below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper closer to the wall until it gently bumps into the wall
    Once the gripper is against the wall and the puck is trapped, slide the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until the puck is at the target location
