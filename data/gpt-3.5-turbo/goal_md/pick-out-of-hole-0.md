To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the hole with enough space to fit the peg
2. Move the gripper down into the hole
3. Close the gripper around the peg
4. Lift the gripper out of the hole
5. Move gripper to target location above the hole
6. Move gripper down to place peg at the target location

- If the robot's gripper is not above the hole, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
- If the gripper is not in the hole, move it down into the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the hole
- If the robot's gripper is above the hole, lift the gripper out of the hole
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is lower and aligned with the target location
- If the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location, move the robot's gripper down to the target location
