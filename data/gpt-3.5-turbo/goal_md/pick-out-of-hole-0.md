The robot needs to grab the peg, lift it out of the hole, move it to the target location, and release it. Here are the steps it should take:

    1. Put gripper above the peg in the hole
    2. Drop gripper around the peg
    3. Close gripper around the peg
    4. Lift the peg out of the hole
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is touching the wall of the hole, move the robot's gripper upwards until the peg is lifted out of the hole
    5. Move the peg to the target location
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, move the robot's gripper until it is near the target location
    6. Release the peg at the target location
