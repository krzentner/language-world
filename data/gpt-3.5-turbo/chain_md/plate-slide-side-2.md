To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the plate from the side  2. Push gripper into edge of plate  3. Push the plate towards the target location
    The robot can slide the plate by pushing it from the side with the gripper. First, move the gripper near the plate from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate from the side, the robot should move the gripper near the plate from the side.
    Once the gripper is near the plate from the side, push it into the edge of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate from the side and the robot's gripper is not pushing into the edge of the plate, the robot should push the gripper into the edge of the plate.
    We've now trapped the plate with the gripper from the side. We can now slide the plate towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing into the edge of the plate, the robot should push the plate towards the target location.
