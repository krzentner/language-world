To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Line up the gripper with the button from the front 2. Move the gripper close to the button while avoiding the wall 3. Push down on the button

First, the robot should line up the gripper with the button from the front. 
- When the gripper is not aligned with the button from the front, the robot should put the gripper in front of the button.

Next, the robot should move the gripper close to the button while avoiding the wall. The robot needs to plan a path to approach the button without hitting the wall.
- When the robot's path to the button is blocked by the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the button that does not have the wall and then move around the wall toward the button.

Once the robot is close to the button and the gripper is lined up with it, push down on the button to activate it.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the button and close to it, the robot should push down on the button.
