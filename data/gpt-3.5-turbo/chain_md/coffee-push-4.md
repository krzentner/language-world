To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above mug handle  2. Drop gripper around mug handle  3. Close gripper around mug handle  4. Pick up mug handle by moving gripper up  5. Move gripper to target location  6. Place mug by moving gripper down and releasing handle
    First, put the gripper above the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is above the handle, the gripper should be dropped around the handle to prepare for grabbing.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the mug handle and the gripper is not around the handle, the robot should drop gripper around mug handle.
    The gripper should then be closed around the handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around mug handle.
    Even if the gripper is around the handle, the mug could still fall if we don't pick it up securely. So we need to move the gripper upwards to firmly grip the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around mug handle and the robot's gripper is not near its highest position, the robot should pick up mug handle.
    Once the mug has been firmly gripped, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move gripper to the target location.
    To place the mug at the target location, the robot needs to move the gripper downwards to place the mug, then release the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above target location and the gripper is holding the mug, the robot should place mug by moving gripper down and releasing handle.
