To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Grab stick with gripper  3. Align gripper and stick with thermos handle  4. Grab thermos handle with stick  5. Pull thermos to goal
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    Once the gripper is above the stick, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is not around stick, the robot should grab the stick.
    After the gripper has the stick, align it with the thermos handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not in line with the thermos handle, the robot should align gripper and stick with thermos handle.
    Once the gripper and stick are aligned with the thermos handle, use the stick to grab the thermos handle.
    - When the robot's gripper and stick are aligned with thermos handle and the stick is not around the thermos handle, the robot should grab the thermos handle with stick.
    Once the thermos handle is securely held by the stick, pull it towards the goal.
    - When the thermos handle is grabbed by the stick, the robot should pull the thermos to the goal.
