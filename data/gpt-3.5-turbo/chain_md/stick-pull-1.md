To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the bottom of the stick  2. Close the gripper around the stick  3. Move the stick to hook the thermos handle  4. Pull the stick and the thermos towards the target location
    First, put the gripper near the bottom of the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the bottom of the stick, the robot should move the gripper near the bottom of the stick.
    Once the gripper is near the bottom of the stick, close the gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the bottom of the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
    Move the stick so that it hooks onto the thermos handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the stick and the stick is not hooked onto the thermos handle, the robot should move the stick to hook the thermos handle.
    Pull the stick and the thermos towards the target location.
    - When the stick is hooked onto the thermos handle, the robot should pull the stick and the thermos towards the target location.
