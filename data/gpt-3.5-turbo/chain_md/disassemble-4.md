To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper roughly above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put the gripper above the wrench.
    Once the gripper is positioned above the wrench, close the gripper around the wrench to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the gripper is not closed around the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench with the gripper.
    Finally, pull the wrench off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench off the peg.
