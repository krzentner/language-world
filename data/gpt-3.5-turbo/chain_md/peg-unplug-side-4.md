To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Slide the peg out sideways from the hole
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
    If the gripper is aligned with the peg, close it to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab peg.
    Once the gripper is around the peg, just slide the peg sideways out of the hole.
    - When the peg is still inside the hole, the robot should slide peg out sideways from the hole.
