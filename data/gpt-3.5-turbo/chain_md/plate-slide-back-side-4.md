To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper on the side of the plate, close to the edge. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not on the side of the plate, the robot should position the gripper on the side of the plate.
2. Push the gripper into the edge of the plate to hold it firmly.
3. Slide the plate back into the target location.
    - While holding the plate in place with the gripper, the robot should slide the plate back towards the target location. 

If the plate is not aligned properly with the gripper, the robot may need to reposition the gripper to ensure a firm grip on the plate. Additionally, if the plate is too heavy for the gripper to hold, the robot may need to use a stronger gripper or adjust the force applied by the gripper.
