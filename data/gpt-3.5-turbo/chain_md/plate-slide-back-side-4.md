To slide the plate back sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the plate towards the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a flat object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the side instead of above it.
    - When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not sideways aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the plate.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't at the target location yet, move the plate towards the target location.
    - When the plate is not within the target location area, the robot should move the plate towards the target location.
    If the plate is lined up with the target location from the side, slide it in.
    - When the plate is sideways aligned with the target location rectangle, the robot should slide the plate back into the target location.
