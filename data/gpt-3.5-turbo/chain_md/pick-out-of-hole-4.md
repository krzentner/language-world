To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Lower gripper into the hole  3. Grab the peg with the gripper  4. Move the peg to the target location
    The first step is to position the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put the gripper above the hole.
    Next, the gripper should be lowered into the hole to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the robot's gripper is not inserted in the hole, the robot should lower the gripper into the hole.
    Once the gripper is inside the hole and has a firm grasp on the peg, the gripper can be raised again.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is inside the gripper, the robot should lift the gripper and peg up out of the hole.
    Finally, the peg can be moved to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
