To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck to bring puck near wall  3. Move gripper and puck towards wall until puck contacts the wall  4. Lift gripper and puck over the wall  5. Slide puck to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't accidentally knock the puck off while moving the gripper towards it. Then, push the gripper down onto the top of the puck to bring the puck near the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    If the gripper is close to the puck and we have a clear path to the wall, move the gripper down towards the wall until the puck contacts the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and there is a clear path to the wall, the robot should move gripper and puck towards the wall until puck contacts wall.
    Once the puck is against the wall, lift the gripper and puck over the wall towards the goal.
    - When the puck is against the wall, the robot should lift gripper and puck over the wall towards goal.
    Finally, slide the puck to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper and puck are over the wall and near the goal, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
