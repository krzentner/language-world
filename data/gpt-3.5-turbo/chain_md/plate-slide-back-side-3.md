To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put gripper under the plate  2. Push gripper into the plate and lift it up  3. Move the plate to the target location and slide it towards the back
    First, put the gripper under the plate, making sure that the gripper is centered under the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not centered under the plate, the robot should center the gripper under the plate.
    Once the gripper is centered under the plate, push the gripper into the plate and lift it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is centered under the plate and the robot's gripper is not inside the plate, the robot should push the gripper into the plate and lift it up.
    Once the gripper is inside the plate and holding it securely, move the plate to the target location and slide it towards the back.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate and the plate is not at the target location, the robot should move the plate to the target location and slide it towards the back.
