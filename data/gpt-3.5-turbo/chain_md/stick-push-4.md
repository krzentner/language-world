To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick to grab it 3. Move gripper to top of stick, and lift it off the table surface  4. Line up the stick with the thermos  5. Push the thermos towards goal using stick

    First, put the gripper roughly above the stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place gripper above the stick.
    Once our gripper is above the stick, we should try to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the stick to grab it.
    Lift the stick off the table surface.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the stick, the robot should move the gripper to the top of the stick and lift it off the table surface.
    Line up the stick with the thermos.
    - When the stick is lifted off the table surface and not yet aligned with the thermos, the robot should align the stick with the thermos.
    Push the thermos towards the goal using the stick.
    - When the stick is aligned with the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal using the stick.
