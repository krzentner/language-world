To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate
           2. Move the gripper over the plate
           3. Push the plate back into the target location
    
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should place the gripper above the plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, move it over the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the plate, the robot should move the gripper over the plate.
    Once the gripper is over the plate, push the plate back into the target location by sliding it sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is over the plate, the robot should push the plate back into the target location by sliding it sideways.
