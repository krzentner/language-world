The task `assembly` can be broken down into two subtasks: grabbing the wrench and wrapping it around the peg.

To grab the wrench, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    First, the robot needs to position the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, the robot should grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around wrench.

To wrap the wrench around the peg, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Line up the wrench with the peg  2. Rotate the wrench to wrap around the peg
    First, the robot needs to line up the wrench with the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the peg, the robot should line up wrench with the peg.
    Once the wrench is lined up with the peg, the robot needs to rotate the wrench to wrap it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg, the robot should rotate the gripper to wrap the wrench around the peg.

Note that the exact details of how to line up the wrench with the peg and how to wrap the wrench around the peg will depend on the exact setup and geometry of the objects involved.
