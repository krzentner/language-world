To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck and the short wall
2. Move the gripper down to the puck and grab it
3. Lift the gripper and the puck above the short wall
4. Move the gripper to the target location
5. Lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location

For step 1, the robot should position the gripper such that it is above both the puck and the short wall. 

For step 2, the robot should move the gripper down to the puck and grab it using the gripper.

For step 3, the robot should lift the gripper and the puck above the short wall to avoid colliding with it. 

For step 4, the robot should move the gripper to the target location while holding onto the puck. 

For step 5, the robot should lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location.
