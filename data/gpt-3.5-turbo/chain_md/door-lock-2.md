To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper near the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial to the correct combination
First, put the gripper near the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper towards the dial.
Once the gripper is near the dial, grab the dial with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the gripper is not closed, the robot should close gripper around the dial.
Now that the gripper has a firm grasp on the dial, turn the dial to the correct combination.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the dial, turn the dial to the correct combination.
