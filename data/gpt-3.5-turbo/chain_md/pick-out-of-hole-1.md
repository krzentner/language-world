To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the hole  2. Align the gripper with the peg  3. Grab the peg with the gripper  4. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
    Check if the gripper is aligned with the peg from above. If it is, move the gripper down to try to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should align the gripper with the peg.
    Close the gripper around the peg to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper.
    Finally, move the peg to the target location while holding it with the gripper.
    - When the peg is picked up with the gripper, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
