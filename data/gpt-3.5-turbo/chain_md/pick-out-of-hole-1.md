The robot must first locate and approach the hole. Once the hole is located, the robot should descend the gripper to a point just above the peg. The gripper should then be carefully lowered into the hole until it can grasp the peg. Once the gripper has firmly grasped the peg, it can be lifted out of the hole and moved to the target location. Finally, the gripper can release the peg at the target location. 

So, the following steps can be performed by the robot:

    Steps:  1. Locate and approach the hole  2. Descend gripper above the peg  3. Carefully lower the gripper into the hole to grasp the peg  4. Lift the gripper with the peg out of the hole  5. Move the gripper to the target location  6. Release the peg at the target location
