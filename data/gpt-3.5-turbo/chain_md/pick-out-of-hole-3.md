To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg inside the hole  2. Close gripper around the peg  3. Lift the peg out of the hole  4. Move the peg to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the peg inside the hole, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg inside the hole, the robot should place gripper above the peg inside the hole.
    If the gripper isn't around the peg, put it around the peg by lowering the gripper inside the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the peg.
    Once we have a good grip on the peg, lift it out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
    Finally, move the peg to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg above the hole, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
