To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is not around the plate, move it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around plate.
    As long as the gripper is mostly around the plate, the gripper can move the plate. Line up the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should align plate to target location.
    If the plate is aligned with the target location sideways, slide it into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate sideways into target location.
