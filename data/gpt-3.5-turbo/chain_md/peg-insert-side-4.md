    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the peg  2. Grab the peg  3. Move the gripper to the hole and rotate the gripper to change the peg's alignment  4. Insert the peg into the hole
    First, put the gripper near the peg, so that we can grab it easily.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move the gripper near the peg.
    Once the gripper is near the peg, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the peg.
    Next, move the gripper to the hole and rotate it in order to align the peg with the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hole, the robot should rotate the gripper to align the peg with the hole.
    Once the peg is aligned with the hole, we can insert it into the hole.
    - When the peg is aligned with the hole, the robot should insert the peg into the hole.
