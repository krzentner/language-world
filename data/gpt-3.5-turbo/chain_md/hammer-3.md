To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Pick up the hammer by putting the gripper around the handle  2. Position the hammer above the nail to be hit  3. Lower the hammer so that the head is touching the nail  4. Swing the hammer down with enough force to hit and drive in the nail
    First, put the gripper around the hammer handle to pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the hammer handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around hammer handle.
    Next, position the hammer above the nail to be hit.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail to be hit, the robot should place gripper above nail.
    Once the hammer is positioned above the nail, lower the hammer with enough force to hit the nail and drive it in.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail to be hit and the hammer head is not touching the nail, the robot should lower hammer head onto nail.
    Finally, swing the hammer down with enough force to hit and drive in the nail.
    - When the hammer head is touching the nail, the robot should swing hammer down with enough force to drive in the nail.
