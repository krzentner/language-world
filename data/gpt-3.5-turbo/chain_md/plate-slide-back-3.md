To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper back to the target location while keeping it level  4. Slide the plate into the target location
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
When the gripper is above the plate, grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate, the robot should grab the plate.
While keeping the gripper level to prevent the plate from falling off, move the gripper back to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should move the gripper to the target location while keeping the gripper level.
Once the gripper is at the target location, slide the plate into the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
