I'm sorry, but before I can suggest steps for the task `basketball`, can you please provide more details on the scenario? For example, what kind of robot are we using, what kind of gripper does it have, what is the size and shape of the ball and the hoop, and what obstacles are present in the environment? This information is necessary for me to suggest the most appropriate and reliable steps for completing the task.
