To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck  3. Slide puck towards wall  4. Tilt gripper to slide puck over the wall  5. Slide puck to goal
    Firstly, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    When the puck is near the wall, we should tilt the gripper to slide the puck over the wall.
    - When the puck is near the wall, the robot should tilt the gripper to slide the puck over the wall.
    After the puck is over the wall, we can slide it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper and the puck is past the wall, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
