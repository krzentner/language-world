To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Slide gripper towards the wall, until it hits the wall
4. Move the gripper sideways to get around the wall
5. Slide the puck towards the goal 
6. Release the gripper once the puck reaches the goal. 

The robot needs to follow these additional steps to reach the target location with the wall in the way.
