To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Drop gripper around plate  3. Push against plate to slide it sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the plate.
    If the gripper is near the plate and the plate is roughly aligned with our target location, we can push against the plate to slide it sideways into the target location.
