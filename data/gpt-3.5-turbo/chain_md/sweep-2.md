To sweep the cube to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube. 2. Grab the cube. 3. Move the cube to the target location sideways. 
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
    Once the gripper is around the cube, we can move it to the target location by moving it sideways.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should move the cube sideways to the target location.
