To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper above puck and move it down so it's just above the puck.
2. Open the gripper to be able to grab the puck.
3. Move the gripper down to grab the puck.
4. Move the gripper up and align it with the target location.
5. Move the gripper down to put the puck on the target location.
6. Close the gripper to release the puck.
