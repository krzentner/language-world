To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the puck  2. Push the puck towards the goal
    If the gripper is not near the puck, we should move the gripper closer to the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should move gripper near puck.
    Once the gripper is near the puck, we can simply push the puck towards the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck, the robot should push puck towards goal.
