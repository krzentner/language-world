The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific position. To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Align gripper with dial  2. Grab the dial  3. Turn the dial to the desired position  4. Release the dial
First, the robot should align the gripper with the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial, the robot should align the gripper with the dial.
Once the gripper is aligned, the robot should grab the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not closed, the robot should grab the dial.
Now that the robot is holding onto the dial, turn it to the desired position.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the dial, turn it to the desired position.
Finally, release the dial.
- When the dial has been turned to the desired position, release it.
