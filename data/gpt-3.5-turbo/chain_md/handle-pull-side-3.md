To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Move the gripper around the handle  3. Pull up on the handle
    First, put the gripper near the handle.
    - When the gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move the gripper near the handle.
    Once the gripper is positioned around the handle, move the gripper around so that it's able to grab onto the handle from the side.
    - When the gripper is not positioned to grab the handle from the side, the robot should move the gripper around the handle.
    Now that the gripper is positioned to grab the handle from the side, pull up on the handle.
    - When the gripper is positioned to grab the handle from the side, the robot should pull up on the handle.
