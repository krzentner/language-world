The robot should perform the following steps to grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably:

1. Put gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and it's not currently holding the peg, the robot should grab the peg.
3. Pull the peg out of the hole.
- If the peg is inserted into the hole, the robot should move the gripper so that it's next to the peg and pull the peg out of the hole.
- When the peg is out of the hole, the task is complete.
