Then, close the gripper around the mug handle to have a firm grip on the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug handle. 
Lift the mug off the table to prepare for moving it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is firmly holding the mug handle, the robot should lift the mug off the table. 
Move the mug to the target location.
- When the robot is holding the mug and near the target location, the robot should move the mug to the target location. 
Lower the mug onto the target location to leave it there.
- When the robot has moved the mug to the target location, the robot should lower the mug onto the target location.
