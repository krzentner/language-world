The steps the robot should perform to push the button on the coffee machine reliably are as follows:

1. Move the gripper towards the coffee machine
2. Line up the gripper with the button on the coffee machine
3. Push down on the button to start the coffee machine
4. Wait for the coffee to finish and then release the button
5. Move the gripper away from the coffee machine

If the robot's gripper is not in the vicinity of the coffee machine, it should move towards the coffee machine.
- When the robot's gripper is far from the coffee machine, the robot should move the gripper towards the coffee machine.

Once the gripper is near the coffee machine, it should be lined up with the button on the coffee machine.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the coffee machine button, the robot should line up the gripper with the coffee machine button.

Once the gripper is aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button to start the coffee machine.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the coffee machine button, the robot should push down on the coffee machine button.

When the coffee is finished being made, the robot should release the button.
- When the coffee is finished and the robot's gripper is still holding the button down, the robot should release the button.

Once the button is released, move the gripper away from the coffee machine.
- When the button is released, the robot should move the gripper away from the coffee machine.
