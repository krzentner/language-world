To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle of the mug  2. Lift the mug to release it from the surface  3. Pull the mug towards the goal  4. Lower the mug onto the surface at the goal
    First, position the gripper around the handle of the mug, making sure that it is securely grasped and the handle is not blocked by the gripper itself.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug, the robot should put gripper around the handle of the mug.
    Next, lift the mug so that it is released from the surface and can be pulled along.
    - When the mug is not lifted off the surface and the robot's gripper is closed around it, the robot should lift the mug.
    Then, pull the mug towards the target location, ensuring that the gripper does not lose its grasp on the handle.
    - When the mug is not at the target location and the robot's gripper contains the mug, the robot should pull the mug towards the target location.
    Finally, lower the mug onto the surface at the target location, making sure that it is not dropped or mishandled.
    - When the mug is at the target location and the robot's gripper contains the mug, the robot should lower the mug onto the surface at the target location.
