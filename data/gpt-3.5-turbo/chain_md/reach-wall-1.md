Here are the steps the robot should follow to reach the target location with a short wall in the way reliably:

1. Move the robot's gripper close to the wall and stop.
   
2. Move the robot's gripper forward along the wall until it reaches the target location. 

3. If the robot cannot move forward without hitting the wall, then it should move the gripper up and over the wall and then move it back down on the other side. 

4. Once the gripper is on the other side of the wall, move it towards the target location again until it reaches the final destination.
   
The robot should make sure to move slowly and keep track of the distance to the wall to avoid hitting it. By lifting the gripper up and over the wall if it cannot move forward, the robot can navigate around obstacles and reach the target location successfully.
