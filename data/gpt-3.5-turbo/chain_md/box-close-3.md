To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above lid  2. Drop gripper around lid  3. Close gripper around lid  4. Move lid to box  5. Align lid with box  6. Place lid on the box
    First, put the gripper roughly above the lid, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the lid, the robot should place gripper above lid.
    If the gripper isn't around the lid, put it around the lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around lid.
    If the gripper is near the lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around lid.
    We closed the gripper, and the lid is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the lid to the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the lid and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the box, the robot should move lid to box.
    Once the lid is close to the box, align the lid with the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the box and the lid is not on the box, the robot should align lid with box.
    Finally, place the lid on the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the box and the lid is aligned with the box, the robot should place lid on the box.
