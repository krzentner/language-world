To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Position the gripper to the side of the peg and slightly above it
           2. Open the gripper and lower it to grab the peg
           3. Lift the gripper with the peg and move it towards the hole
           4. Rotate the gripper to align the peg with the hole
           5. Lower the gripper with the peg into the hole until it's fully inserted
           6. Release the gripper and move it away from the peg

    First, we need to position the gripper to the side of the peg and slightly above it, so we can pick it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should position the gripper to the side and above the peg.
    Once the gripper is positioned correctly, we need to open the gripper and lower it to grab the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is in position and is closed, the robot should open the gripper and lower it to grab the peg.
    Now that the gripper has a hold of the peg, we need to lift it and move it towards the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should lift the gripper and move it towards the hole.
    Once we are close to the hole, we need to rotate the gripper to align the peg with the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the hole, the robot should rotate the gripper to align the peg with the hole.
    We can now lower the gripper with the peg into the hole until it's fully inserted.
    - When the gripper and the peg is aligned with the hole, the robot should lower the gripper with the peg into the hole until it's fully inserted.
    Finally, we can release the gripper and move it away from the peg.
    - When the peg is fully inserted into the hole, the robot should release the gripper and move it away from the peg.
