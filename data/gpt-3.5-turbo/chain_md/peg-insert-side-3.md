The robot should perform the following steps to reliably insert the peg into the hole from the side:
- Put the gripper above the peg
- Grab the peg with the gripper
- Line the peg up with the hole
- Slide the peg sideways into the hole

If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the first step should be to put the gripper above the peg. Once the gripper is above the peg, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper. If the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should line up the peg with the hole. Finally, the robot should slide the peg sideways into the hole. If the peg becomes left of the gripper, the robot should go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, the robot should check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
