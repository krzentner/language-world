To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put the gripper near the dial  2. Grab the dial with the gripper  3. Turn the dial to unlock the door
    First, put the gripper near the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move its gripper near the dial.
    Once the gripper is near the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the dial.
    Now that the dial is being held, turn the dial in order to unlock the door. The direction and number of turns will depend on the specific dial being used in the task.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the dial, the robot should turn the dial to unlock the door.
