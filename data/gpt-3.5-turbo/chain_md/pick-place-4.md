To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the gripper to the target location  4. Release the puck
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above the puck.
    Once the gripper is above the puck, grab the puck by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should put gripper around the puck.
    After grabbing the puck, move the gripper towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at target location, the robot should move gripper to target location.
    Finally, release the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is at target location, the robot should release the puck.
