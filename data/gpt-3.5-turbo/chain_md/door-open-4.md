To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Drop gripper around door handle  3. Pull open the door
    First, put the gripper roughly around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, the robot should move gripper to the door handle.
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can grip the handle by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near door handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around door handle.
    Once the gripper is holding the handle, we can just pull the door open by moving the gripper away from the door.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull away from door.
