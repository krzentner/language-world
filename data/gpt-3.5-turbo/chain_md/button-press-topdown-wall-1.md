To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the button and in front of the wall
2. Lower gripper to touch the button
3. Push down on the button from the top
4. Lift the gripper back up

Since there is a short wall in the way, the robot needs to put the gripper above the button and in front of the wall. 
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and not in front of the wall, the robot should move the gripper above and in front of the button. 
Once the gripper is lined up above the button and in front of the wall, the robot can lower the gripper to touch the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, the robot should lower the gripper to touch the button. 
After touching the button, the robot can push down on the button from the top.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should push down on the button from the top. 
Finally, the robot needs to lift the gripper back up.
- When the robot is finished pushing the button, the robot should lift the gripper back up.
