The task `sweep-into` requires the robot to grab the cube and move it to the target location. Here are the steps the robot should perform to complete this task reliably:

1. Put gripper above one end of the cube
2. Drop gripper down around the cube
3. Close the gripper around the cube
4. Lift the cube up
5. Move the gripper and cube towards the target location
6. Lower the gripper and cube towards the target location
7. Open the gripper to release the cube

First, put the gripper above one end of the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above one end of the cube, the robot should put gripper above one end of the cube.

Once the gripper is roughly above one end of the cube, drop it down around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is roughly above one end of the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper down around the cube.

Next, close the gripper around the cube to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.

Lift the cube up to prepare for moving it towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should lift the cube up.

Move the gripper and cube towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper and cube towards the target location.

Lower the gripper and cube towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper and cube are near the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and cube towards the target location.

Finally, open the gripper to release the cube at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper and cube are at the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper to release the cube.
