To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Move the gripper towards the wall, near the top of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move gripper near the wall.
2. Lower the gripper until it reaches the other side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should lower gripper until it reaches the other side of the wall.
3. Move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall, the robot should move gripper towards the target location.
4. Once the gripper is near the target location, move it down until it reaches the target.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should move gripper down until it reaches the target.
