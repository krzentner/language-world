To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Pull the thermos towards the goal with the stick
    First, put the gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above the stick.
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around stick.
    Once the gripper is holding on to the stick, move it towards the thermos until the stick touches the thermos. 
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is not touching the thermos, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
    Use the stick to grab onto the thermos by positioning it so that the stick is gripping the top of the thermos and then closing the gripper.
    - When the stick is touching the top of the thermos and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
    Use the stick to pull the thermos towards the goal.
    - When the stick is holding onto the thermos, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos towards the goal.
