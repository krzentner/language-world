To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Position gripper with stick near thermos  4. Push thermos using the stick to the target location
First, put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above the stick.
Once the gripper is lined up with the stick, grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, the robot should grab the stick.
Once the robot has a hold of the stick, move the gripper towards the thermos, positioning the stick near the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, the robot should position the gripper with the stick near the thermos.
When the gripper is positioned with the stick near the thermos, use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is in contact with the thermos, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
