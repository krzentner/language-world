To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Align the end of the stick with the thermos  2. Push the thermos with the stick towards the goal location
First, align the end of the stick with the thermos so that we can push it properly.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick above the thermos.
Once the end of the stick is aligned with the thermos, push it towards the goal location to move the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the thermos, the robot should push the thermos with the stick towards the goal location.
