The robot can slide the puck over the wall by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. Here are the steps it should follow:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck on the side closer to the goal  3. Move the gripper over the wall, then push the puck to the goal
    If the puck isn't below the gripper and to the left of the wall as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck and to the left of the wall to slide it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the puck is not to its left as seen from above, the robot should put the gripper above the puck and to the left of the wall.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck from above.
    Once the gripper is trapping the puck, move it over the wall to the other side, then push the puck to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck, the puck is trapped between the gripper and the wall, and the gripper is over the other side of the wall, the robot should push the puck towards the goal.
