The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific position. To do so reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the dial  2. Drop gripper around the dial  3. Turn the dial in the desired direction until it reaches the desired position
    First, put the gripper above the dial, so that we have a clear view of the dial and can avoid bumping it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should place gripper above the dial.
    Once the gripper is above the dial, drop the gripper around the dial to get a good grip on it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the dial.
    Once the gripper is around the dial, we can turn it in the desired direction until it reaches the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, turn the dial in the desired direction until it reaches the desired position.
