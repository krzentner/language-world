To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Push gripper into the top of the puck  3. Move the puck to the wall  4. Tilt the gripper to lift the puck over the wall  5. Slide the puck towards the goal  6. Tilt the gripper back to level to regain control of the puck  7. Release the puck at the goal location
First, put the gripper roughly above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
Then push the gripper into the top of the puck to trap it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is not pushing into the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the top of the puck.
When the gripper is close to the wall, tilt the gripper to lift the puck over the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wall, the robot should tilt the gripper to lift the puck over the wall.
Once the puck is on the other side of the wall, tilt the gripper back to level to regain control of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is past the wall and the gripper is tilted, the robot should tilt the gripper back to level.
Move the puck towards the goal and release it at the goal location.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the goal location, the robot should release the puck at the goal location.
