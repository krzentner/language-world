The steps that the robot should perform to turn the dial on the door reliably are:

1. Put gripper on dial: Move the robot's gripper above the dial of the door. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, the robot should put the gripper on the dial.

2. Grab the dial: Close the gripper around the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the dial.

3. Rotate the dial: Turn the dial in the correct direction to unlock the door. This can be achieved by rotating the gripper in the desired direction.
- When the robot's gripper has grabbed the dial, it should rotate the dial in the desired direction.

4. Release the dial: Open the gripper to let go of the dial.
- When the robot's gripper has turned the dial, it should release the dial by opening the gripper.

Note: The direction to turn the dial may vary depending on the lock mechanism used in the door. The robot should be programmed accordingly to rotate the dial in the correct direction for unlocking the door.
