To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle, the robot should move gripper to the right of the window handle.
2. If the gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide the window to the left.
3. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder. The robot should continue pushing the window harder until it is fully open.
