To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Place the gripper above the plate  2. Move the gripper towards the plate  3. Push the plate to the target location
    First, place the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    Once the gripper is above the plate, move it towards the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper towards the plate.
    If the gripper is aligned with the plate but not near it, move the gripper down to the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should push the plate towards the target location.
