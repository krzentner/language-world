The task `handle-pull` requires the robot to pull up the handle.
To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle  2. Pull up on the handle
    First, put the gripper around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, pull up on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and around the handle, the robot should pull up on handle.
