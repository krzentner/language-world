To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the window handle  2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window  3. Push the window closed harder
    If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to left of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window closed now by moving the gripper right.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be behind the window handle, push harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.
