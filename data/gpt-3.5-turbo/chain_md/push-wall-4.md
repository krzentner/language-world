For `push-wall`, the robot should perform the following steps:
  Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into top of puck until it hits the wall  3. Move the gripper to level with the top of the wall  4. Push on the top of the wall to slide the puck to the goal
We need to get the gripper above the puck as usual, but then we need to push down on the puck until it hits the wall. Then, we move the gripper up to be level with the top of the wall, and push on the top of the wall to slide the puck to the goal.
