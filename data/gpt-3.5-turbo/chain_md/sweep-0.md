To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Move the gripper sideways towards the target location  4. Release the cube at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should grab the cube with the gripper.
    Move the gripper sideways towards the target location while still holding onto the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding onto the cube and the gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move the gripper sideways towards the target location.
    Once the gripper is at the target location, release the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and holding onto the cube, the robot should release the cube.
