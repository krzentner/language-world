To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Move gripper over the wall: If the gripper is not already over the wall, the robot should move the arm and gripper over the wall to the other side using the joint functions of the robot arm. 
2. Reach towards the target: Once the gripper is over the wall, the robot can simply move the gripper towards the target location. 
3. Adjust distance if needed: If needed, the robot can adjust the distance to the target location by moving the arm and gripper closer or farther away from the target. 
4. Grab or touch the target if needed: Once the gripper is close enough to the target, the robot can either simply touch the target or grab and pick it up if required.
