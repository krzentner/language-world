To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above  2. Move gripper above wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    First, line up the robot's gripper from above with the button. Then, move the gripper above the wall to reach the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    - When the button is behind the wall and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should move gripper above wall.
    Now that the gripper is above the wall and lined up with the button, just push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should push down on the button.
