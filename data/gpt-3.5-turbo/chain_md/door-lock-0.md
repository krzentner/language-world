To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper to the dial handle  2. Grip the dial handle  3. Turn the dial to the desired combination
    First, move the gripper to the dial handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial handle, the robot should move gripper to the dial handle.
    Once the gripper is near the dial handle, we should be able to grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grip the dial handle.
    After the gripper has a solid grip on the dial handle, we can turn it to the desired combination.
    - When the robot's gripper is gripping the dial handle, the robot should turn the dial to the desired combination.
