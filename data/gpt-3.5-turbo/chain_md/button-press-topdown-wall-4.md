    First, line up the robot's gripper from above with the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Move the gripper forward until it hits the wall.
    - When the gripper is not hitting the wall and the gripper is above button, the robot should move gripper forward until it hits the wall.
    Rotate the gripper to push the button down from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is hitting the wall and the gripper is not rotated, the robot should rotate gripper to push button down from above.
    Finally, lift the gripper up to release the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is rotated and the gripper is not lifted up, the robot should lift gripper up.
