To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper vertically above the button  2. Slide gripper forward until it hits the wall  3. Slide gripper right or left to line up with the button  4. Push down on the button from the top
    Because of the short wall, the robot cannot simply put the gripper straight down on the button. First, the gripper should be lined up vertically with the button from above.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Next, gently slide the gripper forward until it softly hits the wall. Now the gripper is ready to be moved right or left to line up with the button.
    - When the gripper is touching the wall and the gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, the robot should slide gripper right or left to align with button.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the button, just push down on the button from the top.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should push down on button.
