The task `button-press` requires the robot to push the button from the front.
To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up gripper with button from the front  2. Push gripper into button to press it
    Since this is not "topdown", the robot needs to line up the gripper with the button from the front.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper in front of button.
    Now that the gripper is lined up with the button from the front, push the gripper into the button to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the button, the robot should push gripper into button to press it.
