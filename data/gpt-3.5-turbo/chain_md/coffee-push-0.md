The task `coffee-push` requires the robot to grab the mug and move it to the target location.
To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the center of the handle  2. Drop the gripper around the mug handle  3. Lift the mug using the gripper  4. Position the mug above the target location  5. Lower the mug into the target location
    First, line up the gripper above the center of the handle to prepare for grabbing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the center of the mug handle, the robot should adjust grip position above the center of the handle.
    Once the gripper is properly above the handle, drop it around the handle to grab the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the center of the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle to hold the mug.
    Once the mug is securely gripped, lift it using the gripper in preparation for moving it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the robot's gripper is not lifting the mug, the robot should lift the mug using the gripper.
    Align the mug above the target location to prepare for lowering it.
    - When the mug is not positioned properly above the target location, the robot should position the mug above the target location.
    Lower the mug into the target location to complete the task.
    - When the mug is properly positioned above the target location, the robot should lower the mug into the target location.
