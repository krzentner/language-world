I'm sorry, `hand-insert` task is not defined. However, for similar tasks where the robot needs to pick up an object and move it to a target location, the following steps can be performed:

1. Put gripper above the object and open the gripper.
2. Move the gripper down around the object and close the gripper around it.
3. Lift the object up.
4. Move the gripper to the target location.
5. Put gripper down on the target location and release the object.
