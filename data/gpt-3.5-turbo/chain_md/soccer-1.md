To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the soccer ball  2. Push gripper into the soccer ball  3. Move the soccer ball to goal
    Since the soccer ball is round, we should try to put the gripper near it rather than aiming for a specific point on the ball. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, the robot should move gripper close to soccer ball.
    Once the gripper is near the soccer ball, we can push it using the same technique as pushing the puck - by trapping it from above. Push the gripper into the top of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not pushed into it, the robot should push gripper into soccer ball.
    With the soccer ball trapped by the gripper, we can move it to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushed into the soccer ball, the robot should move the soccer ball to the goal.
