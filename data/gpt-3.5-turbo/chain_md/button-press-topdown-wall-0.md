    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above and move the robot closer to the wall  2. Tilt the gripper towards the button to clear the wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    Because there is a short wall in the way, the robot needs to be closer to the wall and tilt the gripper towards the button to clear the wall. Line up the robot's gripper and move the robot closer to the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and robot is not close to the wall, the robot should move closer to the wall and line up the gripper above the button.
    Tilt the gripper towards the button to clear the wall and then push down on the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button, the robot should tilt the gripper towards the button and then push down on the button from the top.
