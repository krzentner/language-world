The steps to pull the door open reliably are:
1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
2. If the gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the door handle, put the gripper above the door handle.
3. Once the gripper is almost lined up, closing it should line it up all the way.
4. As long as the gripper is still vertically aligned with the door handle, keep pulling.
