To slide the plate back into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate back to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the gripper isn't around the plate, put it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the plate.
    If the gripper is near the plate, we've probably trapped the plate and can slide it back. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate back to the target location.
