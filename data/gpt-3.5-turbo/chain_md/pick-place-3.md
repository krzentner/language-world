To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the puck to the target location  4. Release the grip to place the puck
    First, align the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    Once the gripper is aligned above the puck, close the gripper to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should grab the puck.
    Move the gripper to the target location where the puck should be placed.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
    Once the gripper is at the target location, release the grip to place the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the robot's gripper is around the puck, the robot should release the grip to place the puck.
