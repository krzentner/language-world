Here are the steps the robot should perform to put the ball into the hoop:

1. Move the gripper above the ball.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
2. Grab the ball with the gripper.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the ball with the gripper.
3. Move the gripper above the hoop.
   - When the gripper is holding onto the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the hoop.
4. Drop the ball into the hoop.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the robot's gripper is holding the ball, the robot should drop the ball into the hoop. 

Note that the height and distance needed to reach the ball and hoop depend on their specific positions. These steps assume the ball is held in a standardized way, such as from the top or from the sides, and that the robot can easily locate and move towards the hoop.
