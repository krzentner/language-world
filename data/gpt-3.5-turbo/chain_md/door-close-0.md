To push the door closed to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Push the door closed towards the target location
    First, if the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should grab the door handle.
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can push the door closed towards the target location.
