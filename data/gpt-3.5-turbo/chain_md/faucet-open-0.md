To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps: 1. Locate the faucet handle 2. Position the gripper around the faucet handle 3. Twist the faucet handle to the left to turn on the water
   First, the robot needs to locate the faucet handle. Once the handle is located, the robot needs to position the gripper around the handle to be able to grip it.
   - When the robot hasn't located the faucet handle yet or if the handle is not in the field of view, the robot should search for the handle.
   If the handle is not aligned with the gripper, adjust the position of the gripper to be able to grip the handle securely.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around or aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should position the gripper securely around the handle.
   Finally, once the robot's gripper is securely around the handle, it can turn the handle to the left to turn on the water.
   - When the robot's gripper is securely around the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle to the left to open the faucet and turn on the water.
