To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    
   Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench handle
          2. Grab the wrench handle with the gripper
          3. Lift the wrench up and disengage it from the peg
          4. Move the wrench to the desired location
   
   First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put gripper above the wrench.
   Once the gripper is above the wrench handle, close the gripper around the handle to grab it.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the wrench handle.
   Once the gripper has secured the wrench handle, lift the wrench handle up to disengage it from the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench handle and the wrench handle is not disengaged from the peg, the robot should lift the wrench up to disengage it from the peg.
   Finally, move the wrench to the desired location.
   - When the wrench handle is disengaged from the peg and the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should move the wrench to the desired location.
