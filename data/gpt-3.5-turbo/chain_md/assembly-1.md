Unfortunately, I cannot perform this task as it is not specified which wrench and which peg are being used. However, I can provide general instructions that may be adapted to the specific scenario. 

Steps:
1. Place the gripper above the wrench.
2. Grab the wrench with the gripper.
3. Move the gripper to the peg.
4. Position the wrench around the peg.
5. Tighten the wrench around the peg.
6. Release the gripper from the wrench.

If the gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put the gripper above the wrench. If the wrench becomes misaligned with the gripper, the robot should reposition the gripper around the wrench. Similarly, if the gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move the gripper closer to the peg. And if the wrench is not positioned correctly around the peg, the robot should adjust its position until correct. Finally, if the gripper is still holding the wrench, release it to complete the task.
