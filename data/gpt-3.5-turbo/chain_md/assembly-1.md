The task `assembly` requires the robot to put the wrench around the peg. To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench and peg  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper and position it around the peg  3. Close the gripper to hold the wrench in place
    First, put the gripper above the wrench and the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench and peg, the robot should put gripper above the wrench and peg.
    Grab the wrench with the gripper and move it towards the peg, positioning it around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and peg and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the wrench and position it around the peg.
    Close the gripper to hold the wrench in place around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and peg and the gripper is closed, the robot should hold the wrench in place.
