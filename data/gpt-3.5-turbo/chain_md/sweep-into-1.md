The task `sweep-into` requires the robot to sweep the cube into its gripper and move it to the target location. To do so reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Place gripper angled towards the cube and the target location  2. Sweep the gripper towards the cube, trapping it inside  3. Lift the gripper with the cube  4. Move the gripper to the target location  5. Release the cube at the target location
    
    First, the robot should place the gripper angled towards the cube and the target location to set up for the sweeping motion.
    - When the robot's gripper is not angled towards the cube and the target location, the robot should place gripper in angled position.
    Next, the robot should sweep the gripper towards the cube, trapping it inside the gripper.
    - When the gripper is not close to the cube, the robot should sweep the gripper towards the cube to trap it inside.
    Once the gripper has trapped the cube, the robot should lift the gripper with the cube inside to move it to the target location.
    - When the gripper has trapped the cube, the robot should lift the gripper with the cube inside.
    Once the gripper is positioned over the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the location and release the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is at target location, the robot should release the cube to place it at the target location.
