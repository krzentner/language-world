To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Drop gripper around the plate  3. Close gripper around the plate  4. Move the plate to the goal location while keeping it sideways.
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    If the gripper is not around the plate, move it around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the plate.
    If the gripper is near the plate and open, we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around plate.
    We closed the gripper, and the plate is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Now we need to move the plate towards the goal location, while keeping it sideways.
    - While moving the plate towards the goal location, the robot should keep the plate sideways. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the goal location, the robot should release the plate.
