I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to advise on the steps for turning a dial on a door. Depending on the mechanism of the lock, the robot may need to grip the dial and turn it a certain number of times in a certain direction or follow a specific sequence to unlock the door. Can you provide more details or context?
