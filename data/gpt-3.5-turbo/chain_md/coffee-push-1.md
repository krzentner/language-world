To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the mug  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Lift the mug up to a safe height  4. Move the mug to the target location  5. Lower the mug to the target surface  6. Release the handle
    First, put the gripper above the mug, aiming for the mug handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
    Once the gripper is above the handle, it can be closed to grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the handle.
    The mug should be lifted to a safe height to avoid damage or spills.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug handle, the robot should lift the mug to a safe height.
    After lifting the mug, move it to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the mug at a safe height, the robot should move the mug to the target location.
    Once the mug is over the target surface, slowly lower it.
    - When the mug is above the target surface, the robot should lower the mug to the target surface.
    Finally, the gripper should be opened to release the handle and let go of the mug.
    - When the mug is on the target surface, the robot should release the handle and let go of the mug.
