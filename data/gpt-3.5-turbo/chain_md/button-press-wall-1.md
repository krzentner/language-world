To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Move the gripper close to the wall, aligned with the button on the other side
2. Rotate the gripper to face the button
3. Move the gripper forward until it presses the button

First, the robot should move the gripper close to the wall, aligned with the button on the other side. 
- When the robot's gripper is not close to the wall and not horizontally aligned with the button, the robot should move the gripper close to the wall, aligned with the button on the other side. 

Next, the robot should rotate the gripper to face the button, so that it can push it.
- When the robot's gripper is not rotated facing the button, the robot should rotate the gripper to face the button.

Finally, the robot should move the gripper forward until it presses the button.
- When the robot's gripper is not pressing the button, the robot should move the gripper forward until the button is pressed.
