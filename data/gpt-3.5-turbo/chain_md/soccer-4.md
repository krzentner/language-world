To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Push the gripper into the soccer ball  3. Push the soccer ball towards the goal
    The robot should first line up the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    The robot should then push the gripper into the soccer ball to trap it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and is not already gripping the soccer ball, the robot should push the gripper into the soccer ball to trap it.
    Once the gripper has trapped the ball, the robot should push the soccer ball towards the goal.
    - When the ball is in front of the robot's gripper and the gripper is holding the ball, the robot should push the soccer ball towards the goal using the gripper.
