To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around faucet handle  2. Turn the gripper right to close faucet  3. Stop turning when faucet is closed
    First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, turn the gripper right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and robot's gripper is open, the robot should turn the gripper right to close the faucet.
    Stop turning when the faucet is closed.
    - When the faucet is closed, the robot should stop turning the gripper.
