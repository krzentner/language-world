To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    If the handle is within reach of the gripper, grab it.
    - When the handle is within reach of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    Push down on the handle with the gripper. 
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle, the robot should push down on the handle.
