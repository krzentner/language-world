To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move gripper to target location  4. Release the puck
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Once the gripper is above the puck, we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around puck, the robot should grab puck.
    Now that we have the puck, we can move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move gripper to target location.
    Once the gripper is at the target location, we can release the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the robot's gripper is around puck, the robot should release puck.
