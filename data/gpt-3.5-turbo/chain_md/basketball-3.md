To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the ball  2. Grab the ball with the gripper  3. Line up the ball with the hoop  4. Release the ball into the hoop
    First, put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put gripper above ball.
    If the ball becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the ball. Because the ball is a round object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from multiple angles to ensure it's grabbing it properly.
    - When ball is not left of the robot's gripper and ball is not mostly surrounded by the gripper, the robot should grab ball.
    As long the gripper is still holding the ball and the ball isn't lined up with the hoop, line up the ball with the hoop.
    - When the ball is lined up with the hoop, the robot should release the ball into the hoop.
