To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Move the gripper to the thermos  4. Hold the stick against the thermos  5. Pull the thermos to the goal
First, put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above the stick.
Once the gripper is above the stick, try to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick with the gripper.
After grabbing the stick, move the gripper to the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, the robot should move the gripper to the thermos.
Once the gripper is near the thermos, place the stick against it.
- When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and is holding the stick, the robot should hold the stick against the thermos.
Finally, pull the thermos towards the goal using the stick held by the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick against the thermos, the robot should pull the thermos towards the goal.
