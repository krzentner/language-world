In order to reach a target location, the robot needs to move its gripper arm in a straight line towards the target. The following steps can be taken:

1. Determine the starting position of the robot's gripper arm.
2. Determine the target position of the robot's gripper arm.
3. Calculate the distance between the starting and target positions.
4. Move the gripper arm towards the target position.
5. Once the gripper arm has reached the target position, the task is complete.

It's important to ensure that the gripper arm does not collide with any objects in its path and that it moves smoothly to the target position. Some robots may also have constraints on the range of motion of their gripper arms that need to be taken into account.
