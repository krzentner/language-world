To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Move gripper close to the wall near button with gripper perpendicular to the wall.  2. Slide the gripper along the wall until it reaches the button.  3. Push button with gripper.
First, move the gripper close to the wall near the button with the gripper perpendicular to the wall.
- When the gripper is not close to the wall near the button and gripper is not perpendicular to the wall, the robot should move gripper close to wall near the button and make the gripper perpendicular to the wall.
Once the gripper is close to the wall, slide the gripper along the wall until it reaches the button.
- When the gripper is not at the button and the gripper is not sliding along the wall, the robot should slide the gripper along the wall until it reaches the button.
Once the gripper is at the button, push the button with the gripper.
- When the gripper is at the button, the robot should push the button.
