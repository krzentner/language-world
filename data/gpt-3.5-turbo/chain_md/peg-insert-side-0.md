To insert the peg into the hole from the side, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
   - When the gripper is above the peg and is open, the robot should close the gripper to grab the peg.
3. Line up the peg with the hole.
   - If the peg is not lined up with the hole, the robot should move the gripper sideways to align the peg with the hole.
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole.
   - When the peg is lined up with the hole, the robot should slide the peg into the hole sideways using the gripper.
