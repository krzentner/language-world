To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper next to peg  2. Open gripper  3. Move gripper around peg  4. Close gripper around peg  5. Move gripper towards hole  6. Insert peg into hole  7. Release gripper

First, put the gripper near the peg. Since we are inserting the peg from the side, we need to place the gripper next to the peg, not above it like in other tasks.
- When the robot's gripper is not next to the peg, the robot should position the gripper next to the peg.
Next, open the gripper to prepare for grabbing the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is next to the peg and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper.
Once the gripper is open, move it around the peg to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper around the peg to grab it.
After grabbing the peg, move the gripper towards the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is not near the hole, the robot should move the gripper towards the hole.
Insert the peg into the hole. For this task, we're inserting the peg from the side, so we don't need to be very precise with the angle of the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the hole, the robot should insert the peg into the hole.
Finally, release the gripper to let go of the peg.
- When the peg is inserted into the hole, the robot should release the gripper.
