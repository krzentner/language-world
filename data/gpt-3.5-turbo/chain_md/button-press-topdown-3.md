I'm sorry, it seems like there was an error in the previous task. I'll assume that you meant to ask for the steps for task `button-press-topdown`. To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the button. 
Make sure that the gripper is directly vertical above the button. 
2. Move the gripper straight downwards onto the button. 
Push the gripper straight downwards until the button is fully pressed down.
