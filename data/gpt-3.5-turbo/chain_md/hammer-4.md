To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the hammer head over the nail head  2. Lower the hammer onto the nail head  3. Swing the hammer to hit the nail
    First, put the hammer head over the nail head.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail head, the robot should move the gripper above the nail head.
    Once the hammer head is over the nail head, lower the hammer onto the nail head.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail head and the hammer head is not touching the nail head, the robot should lower the hammer onto the nail head.
    Now that the hammer head is on the nail head, swing the hammer to hit the nail.
    - When the hammer head is on the nail head, the robot should swing the hammer to hit the nail.
