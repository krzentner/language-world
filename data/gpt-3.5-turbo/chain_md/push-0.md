To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the puck.
If the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move it above the puck.

2. Drop gripper around the puck.
If the gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, drop it around the puck.

3. Push the gripper into the top of the puck.
If the gripper is vertically aligned with the puck but not near it, move it down to the puck.

4. Slide the puck to the goal.
If the gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the gripper, slide the puck to the goal.  

5. Close gripper to trap the puck.
If the gripper is close to the puck, close it to trap the puck and ensure we keep control of it.
