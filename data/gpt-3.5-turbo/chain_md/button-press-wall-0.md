To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Align the gripper to the button and move towards the wall until the gripper touches the wall.
2. Slide the gripper up the wall to determine the height of the button while maintaining the gripper's alignment with the button.
3. Move the gripper towards the button until the gripper is slightly in front of the button.
4. Orient the gripper so that it is perpendicular to the button.
5. Push the button with the gripper.
