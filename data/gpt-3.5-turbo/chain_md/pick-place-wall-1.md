For the task `pick-place-wall`, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Move gripper to the side of the wall closest to the target location
5. Rotate gripper so that it's facing towards the target location
6. Lift gripper and move it over the wall, while keeping the gripper closed around the puck
7. Move gripper to the target location
8. Rotate gripper so that it's facing downwards towards the target location
9. Lower gripper to place the puck at the target location

Note that when moving the gripper over the wall in step 6, the robot should make sure that the gripper doesn't hit the wall or drop the puck while moving it.
