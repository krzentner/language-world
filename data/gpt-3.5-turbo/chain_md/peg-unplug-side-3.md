The steps that the robot should perform to grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably are:

1. Put gripper above the peg
2. Grab the peg with the gripper
3. Twist the gripper to unplug the peg from the hole
4. Pull the gripper with the peg to the side, away from the hole. 

First, put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg. Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
- When peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
Once the gripper has a firm grasp of the peg, twist the gripper to unplug the peg from the hole.
- When the peg is plugged into the hole, the robot should twist the gripper to unplug the peg.
Now that the peg is no longer in the hole, the gripper can pull it to the side.
- When the robot's gripper has unplugged peg and the peg is not next to the gripper, the robot should move the gripper with the peg to the side, away from the hole.
