To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the handle of the mug  2. Lift the mug off the surface  3. Move the mug towards the target location  4. Lower the mug onto the surface at the target location
    First, put the gripper around the handle of the mug.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the mug's handle, the robot should put gripper around the handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, lift the mug off the surface.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the mug is on the surface, the robot should lift the mug off the surface.
    Move the mug towards the target location. If the target location is out of reach, break it down into multiple movements.
    - When the mug is off the surface, the robot should move the mug towards the target location.
    Once the mug is at the target location, lower it onto the surface.
    - When the mug is at the target location, the robot should lower the mug onto the surface.
