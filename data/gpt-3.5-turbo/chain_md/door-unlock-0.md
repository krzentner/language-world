The task `door-unlock` requires the robot to turn the dial on the door in order to unlock it. To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the dial  2. Turn the dial to the correct combination
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around the dial.
    Once the gripper is around the dial, turn it to the correct combination.
    - Turn the dial to the correct combination. This may require multiple attempts to get it right. Once the correct combination is set, the door will unlock.
