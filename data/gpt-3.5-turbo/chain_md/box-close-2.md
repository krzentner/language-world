   Steps: 1. Put gripper above the box lid  2. Grab the box lid with the gripper  3. Put the lid on the box  4. Release the lid
   First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should put the gripper above the box lid.
   If the gripper is not around the box lid, move the gripper around the box lid while being careful not to knock the lid over.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the box lid.
   Line up the box lid above the box and lower the lid onto the box.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should put the lid on the box.
   Release the lid when it's centered on the box.
   - When the lid is centered on the box, the robot should release the lid.
