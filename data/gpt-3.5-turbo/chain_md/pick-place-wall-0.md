To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Approach the puck from the side 2. Put gripper above puck  3. Drop gripper around puck  4. Close gripper around puck  5. Lift the puck over the wall 6. Move puck to goal 7. Lower the puck onto the goal surface

First, approach the puck from the side to avoid the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not laterally aligned with the puck, the robot should approach the puck from the side.
Then, put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the gripper is not too high to clear the wall, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
Since there is a wall blocking the gripper's path, we need to drop the gripper around the puck from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is too high to clear the wall, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck from the side.
If the gripper is open and near the puck, we should try to close it around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is open and near puck, the robot should close gripper around puck.
If the puck is on the other side of the wall, we need to lift the gripper over the wall to reach it.
- When the puck is on the other side of the wall, the robot should lift the gripper over the wall.
Now that the puck is lifted over the wall, we can move the gripper with the puck to the goal location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck and the puck is over the wall, the robot should move the puck to the goal location.
Finally, after we've moved the puck to the goal location, we can lower the puck onto the goal surface.
- When the robot's gripper is over the goal location, the robot should lower the puck onto the goal surface.
