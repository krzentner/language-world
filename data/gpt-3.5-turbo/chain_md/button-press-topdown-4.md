To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button  2. Move the gripper straight down to the button  3. Push the button down
    First, put the gripper above the button so that we're lined up with it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
    Move the gripper straight down to the button to press it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button but not directly above it, the robot should move the gripper straight down to the button.
    Pushing the button should be simple now that we're lined up with it.
    - When the robot's gripper is directly above the button, the robot should push the button down.
