To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Hold stick above thermos  2. Position stick so that it is hooked onto the handle of the thermos  3. Pull the stick towards the target location to slide the thermos
    First, hold the stick above the thermos, with the hook end pointing towards the thermos and the other end towards the robot's gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the thermos, the robot should hold the stick above the thermos.
    Move the stick down so that it hooks onto the handle of the thermos.
    - When the stick is not hooked onto the thermos and the stick is above the thermos, the robot should hook the stick onto the handle of the thermos.
    With the stick hooked onto the thermos, pull the stick towards the target location to slide the thermos to the target.
    - When the stick is hooked onto the thermos and the stick is not towards the target location, the robot should pull the stick towards the target location.
