To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
    1. Put gripper above the stick
    2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    3. Move the gripper and stick to the thermos
    4. Slide the stick under the handle of the thermos
    5. Close the gripper around the stick
    6. Pull the thermos towards the target location by moving the gripper and stick together
    7. Place thermos at the target location by opening the gripper

First, put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick.
If the gripper isn't already gripping the stick, grab the stick with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not gripping the stick and the gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick with the gripper.
Once the gripper and stick are grasping the stick, move them to the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper and stick are not near the thermos, the robot should move the gripper and stick towards the thermos.
Slide the stick under the handle of the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper and stick are near the thermos and the stick is not underneath the handle of the thermos, the robot should slide the stick under the handle of the thermos.
Close the gripper around the stick to ensure that the stick doesn't slip.
- When the robot's gripper and stick are holding onto the stick and the gripper isn't closed, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
Pull the thermos towards the target location by moving the gripper and stick together.
- When the robot's gripper and stick are holding onto the stick and the thermos is not at the target location, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location by moving the gripper and stick together.
Once the thermos is at the target location, place it down by opening the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper and stick are holding onto the thermos at the target location, the robot should place the thermos down by opening the gripper.
