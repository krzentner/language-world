To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the peg  2. Pull the peg sideways out of the hole
    First, put the gripper around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the peg is aligned with the gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull the peg sideways out of the hole.
    - When the peg is aligned with the gripper and the gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg sideways out of the hole.
