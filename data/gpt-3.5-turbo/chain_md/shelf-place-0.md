- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should put gripper above the block.
Move the gripper down to grab the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the block, the robot should move gripper down around the block.
Close the gripper to hold the block securely.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and open, the robot should close gripper around block.
Lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and closed, the robot should lift the block.
Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should move gripper above target location.
Lower the block at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the block at target location.
