To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the block 2. Lower gripper around the block 3. Close gripper around the block 4. Lift the block up 5. Move gripper to the target location 6. Lower gripper and release the block

First, put the gripper above the block, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
If the gripper isn't around the block, lower it around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is safely above the block, the robot should lower the gripper around the block.
If the gripper is near the block and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
We closed the gripper, and the block is still inside it, so we should lift it up.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the block up.
We now need to move the gripper to the target location while holding the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location with the block.
Once the gripper is at the target location, we can lower the gripper and release the block there.
- When the robot's gripper is at the target location and holding the block, the robot should lower the gripper and release the block.
