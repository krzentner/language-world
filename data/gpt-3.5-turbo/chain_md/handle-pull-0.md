To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle upwards
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    If the handle is not yet grasped, open the gripper and move it down around the handle to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around handle.
    If the handle is firmly grasped by the gripper, pull the handle upwards to perform the task.
    - When the robot's gripper is grasping the handle and the handle is not yet pulled up, the robot should pull the handle upwards.
