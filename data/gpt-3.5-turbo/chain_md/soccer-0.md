To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Push gripper into top of soccer ball  3. Move soccer ball to goal
    Similar to pushing the puck, the robot can slide the soccer ball by trapping it by pushing down on it from above and moving the gripper. If the soccer ball isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    If the gripper is aligned with the soccer ball but not near it, move the gripper down to the soccer ball to push it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not near the soccer ball, the robot should push the gripper into the soccer ball.
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can slide it to the target location. Close the gripper to make sure we keep control of the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the soccer ball is below the robot's gripper, the robot should move the soccer ball to the goal.
