The steps the robot should perform to push the soccer ball into the target location are:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Push soccer ball to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, the robot should place gripper above soccer ball.
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around soccer ball.
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the ball is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push the soccer ball towards the goal. 
    If we didn't trap the soccer ball, go back to an earlier step.
