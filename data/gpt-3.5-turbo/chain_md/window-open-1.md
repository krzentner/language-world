To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper on the left side of the window handle  2. Start pulling the window handle to open the window  3. Pull the window open harder
    If the window handle is left of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper close to it to start pulling.
    - When the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
    If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window open now by pulling the handle towards us.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should pull window handle towards us.
    If the robot's gripper is starting to be behind the window handle, pull harder.
    - When the robot's gripper is behind the window handle, the robot should pull window open harder.
