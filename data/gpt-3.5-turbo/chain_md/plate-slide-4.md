To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Put gripper around plate  3. Lift the plate to avoid obstruction  4. Slide the plate to the goal  5. Lower the plate to rest on goal surface
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    If the gripper is not already around the plate, move the gripper around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate, the robot should put gripper around the plate.
    Lift the plate enough to clear any obstructions as the plate is being slid.
    - When the robot's gripper has the plate and is not lifted enough, the robot should lift the plate.
    Slide the plate towards the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper has the plate and the plate is not at goal location, the robot should slide the plate.
    Lower the plate to rest on the goal surface.
    - When the plate reaches the goal location, the robot should lower the plate to rest on the goal surface.
