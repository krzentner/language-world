The robot should perform the following steps to slide the plate into the target location reliably: 
    Steps:  1. Put gripper left of the plate handle  2. Push the plate forward to slide it to the target location  3. Push the plate harder if needed
If the plate handle is to the right of the gripper, move the gripper to the left of the handle.
    - When the plate handle is right of the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper to left of plate handle.
Once the gripper is left of the plate handle, the robot should push the plate towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate handle, the robot should push the plate forward towards the target location.
If the plate is not sliding properly, push harder.
    - When the plate is not sliding easily, the robot should push the plate harder.
