    Steps:  1. Bring the robot's gripper above the ball
    2. Grab the ball with the gripper
    3. Move the gripper towards the hoop
    4. Release the ball at the right moment to make a basket

First, the robot needs to put its gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should put the gripper above the ball.
Once the gripper is above the ball, the robot should grab the ball with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the ball.
Next, the robot needs to move the gripper towards the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball and is not near the hoop, the robot should move the gripper towards the hoop.
Finally, the robot should release the ball at the right moment to make a basket.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the hoop and at the right distance to make a basket, the robot should release the ball.
