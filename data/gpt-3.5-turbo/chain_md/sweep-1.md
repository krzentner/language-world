To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above cube 2. Grab the cube with the gripper 3. Line up the cube with the target location 4. Move the gripper sideways towards the target location 5. Release the cube

First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above cube.
Grab the cube with the gripper, making sure to close the gripper firmly around it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
Once the gripper has a firm grip on the cube, line it up with the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the cube is not aligned with the target location, the robot should align the cube with the target location.
Move the gripper sideways towards the target location. Make sure to keep the cube level so that it doesn't fall out of the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location and the cube is not there yet, the robot should move the gripper sideways towards the target location.
Once the cube has reached the target location, release the gripper to drop the cube into place.
- When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should release the gripper to drop the cube into place.
