To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the puck
2. Grab the puck with the gripper
3. Push the puck towards the goal
4. Release the puck at the goal

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.

Once the gripper is above the puck, the robot should grab the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.

Now that the robot has grabbed the puck, it can push it towards the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should push the puck towards the goal.

Finally, when the robot has pushed the puck to the goal, it should release it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the goal and the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should release the puck at the goal.
