To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps: 1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to push it.
   - When the robot's gripper is not mostly above the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
   If the gripper is not around the puck, move it towards the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should move gripper to puck.
   Once the gripper is around the puck, we can start pushing it towards the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the puck is not at the target location, the robot should slide the puck towards the target.
   If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the puck, push harder.
   - When the robot's gripper is in front of the puck, the robot should push harder towards the target.
