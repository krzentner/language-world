To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above box lid  2. Drop gripper around box lid  3. Close gripper around box lid  4. Move box lid to top of the box  5. Open gripper to release box lid
    First, put the gripper roughly above the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should put the gripper above the box lid.
    If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the box lid.
    If the gripper is near the box lid and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
    We closed the gripper, and the box lid is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to move the box lid to the top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the top of the box and the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should place the box lid on the top of the box.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the top of the box and the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should open the gripper to release the box lid onto the box.
