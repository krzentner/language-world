To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above puck
2. Drop gripper around puck
3. Close gripper around puck
4. Lift gripper up and over the wall
5. Move gripper to the target location
6. Lower gripper to place puck at target location

Instead of just moving the puck to the goal like in the previous task, in this task we need to lift the gripper up and over a short wall before moving the gripper to the target location. 

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck to avoid bumping it while trying to grab it. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.

If the gripper is not around the puck, put it around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.

If the gripper is near the puck and open, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.

Lift the gripper up and over the wall to avoid hitting it.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, lift the gripper up and over the wall to avoid hitting it.

Move the gripper to the target location.
- After the gripper is lifted up and over the wall, move the gripper to the target location.

Lower gripper to place puck at target location.
- When the gripper reaches the target location, lower the gripper to place the puck at the desired location.
