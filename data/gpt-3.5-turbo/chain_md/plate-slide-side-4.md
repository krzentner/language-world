To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly above the plate  2. Move gripper to side of plate  3. Push plate to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate so that we can move it into the position we need.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    Next, move the gripper to the side of the plate so that we can push it into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the side of the plate, the robot should move gripper to the side of plate.
    After the gripper is in the correct position, we can start pushing the plate into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the side of the plate and the plate is not at the goal location, the robot should push the plate towards the goal.
