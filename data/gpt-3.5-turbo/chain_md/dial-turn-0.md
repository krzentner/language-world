The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific position. To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial knob  2. Turn the knob to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial knob.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial knob, the robot should move the gripper to the knob.
    Once the gripper is around the dial knob, we can turn the dial to the desired position. We can accomplish this by rotating the gripper in the appropriate direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial knob, the robot should turn the knob to the desired position.
