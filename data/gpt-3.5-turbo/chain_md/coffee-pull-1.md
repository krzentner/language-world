To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper about an inch above mug's handle
2. Drop gripper around mug's handle
3. Lift the mug straight up
4. Move the gripper to the target location
5. Put the mug down on the target location

First, place the gripper above the mug's handle but far enough so as not to knock it over.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug's handle.
Next, drop the gripper around the mug's handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug's handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around mug's handle.
Lift the mug straight up so that it is securely held by the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug's handle, the robot should lift the mug straight up.
Move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
Finally, put the mug down at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should put the mug down on the target location carefully.
