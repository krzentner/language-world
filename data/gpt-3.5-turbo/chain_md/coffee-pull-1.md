Here are the steps the robot should perform for the `coffee-pull` task:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above handle of the coffee mug
2. Drop gripper around the handle of the coffee mug
3. Close gripper around the handle of the coffee mug securely
4. Move the gripper and the coffee mug together to the target location
5. Once the mug is at the target location, release the grip and let go of the mug. 

Make sure that the gripper is properly lined up with the coffee mug and the handle before grabbing it. If the mug is not initially lined up with the gripper, the robot should line it up by moving the gripper above the handle. Finally, ensure that the mug is securely gripped so that it does not accidentally slip out of the robot's grip while it is being moved to the target location.
