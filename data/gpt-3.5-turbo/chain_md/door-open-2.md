To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the door handle  2. Pull the door open
    If the gripper is not around the door handle, move it to the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around door handle and the robot's gripper is near door handle, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
    Once the gripper is around the door handle, we can just pull the door open.
    - When the robot's gripper is around door handle, the robot should pull away from door.
