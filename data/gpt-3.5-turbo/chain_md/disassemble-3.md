    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Grab the wrench handle with the gripper  3. Forcefully pull the wrench off the peg
    
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, the robot should put gripper above wrench handle.
    When the gripper is above the wrench handle, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the wrench handle.
