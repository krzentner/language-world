To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above the wrench.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the wrench.
    Once we have a grip on the wrench, we can pull it off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper has closed around the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench off the peg.
