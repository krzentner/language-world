To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push gripper into the back of the puck  3. Slide puck backwards towards the goal
    First, put the gripper above the puck so that we don't accidentally push the puck in the wrong direction.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck, the robot should put gripper above puck.
    Push the gripper into the back of the puck to trap it and slide it backwards.
    - When the robot's gripper is above puck, the robot should push gripper into back of puck.
    Slide the puck backwards towards the goal. The gripper should stay in contact with the puck so we keep control of it.
    - When the robot's gripper is in contact with puck, the robot should slide the puck backwards towards the goal.
