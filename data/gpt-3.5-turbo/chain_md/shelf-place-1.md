To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the block 2. Drop gripper down to the block 3. Close gripper around the block 4. Lift the block up 5. Move the block to the target location 6. Lower the block down to the target location 7. Open gripper to release the block
    First, put the gripper above the block so we can pick it up without hitting it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should position the gripper above the block.
    Move the gripper down to the block, so that we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block, the robot should move the gripper down to the block.
    Close the gripper to grab the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
    Once we have the block in the gripper, lift it up so that we can move it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the block up.
    Move the block to the target location while keeping it held in the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block and not yet at the target location, the robot should move the block to the target location.
    Lower the block down to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the block is in the gripper, the robot should lower the block down to the target location.
    Finally, open the gripper to release the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the block is in the gripper, the robot should open the gripper to release the block.
