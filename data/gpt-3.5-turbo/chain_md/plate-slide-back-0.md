To slide the plate back into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate backwards towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate isn't trapped by the gripper yet, grab the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not closed around the plate, the robot should close gripper around the plate.
    If the gripper is holding the plate, slide it backwards towards the target location. 
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate and the plate is not yet at the target location, the robot should slide the plate backwards towards the target location.
