To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper to the right of the window handle.
2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
3. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and is below the window handle, move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
4. If the gripper is close to the window handle, slide the window open by moving the gripper to the left.
5. If the gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder to open the window.
