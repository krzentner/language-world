To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Drop gripper around stick  3. Close gripper around stick  4. Line up stick with thermos  5. Push thermos towards goal with stick  6. Release stick
    
    First, put the gripper roughly above the stick, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place the gripper above the stick.
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the stick.
    If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
    We closed the gripper, and the stick is still near the gripper, so maybe we grabbed it. Try to line up the stick with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the stick and the stick is not lined up with the thermos, the robot should line up the stick with the thermos.
    Once the stick is lined up with the thermos, use the stick to push the thermos towards the goal.
    - When the stick is lined up with the thermos, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the goal.
    Once the thermos is at the goal, release the stick.
    - When the thermos is at the goal, the robot should release the stick.
