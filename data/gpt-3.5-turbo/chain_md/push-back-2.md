To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Push and grip the puck from the back  3. Slide the puck backwards to the goal
    The robot can slide the puck backwards by pushing and gripping it from the back, and then moving the gripper. If the puck isn't below the gripper as seen from above, move the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    If the gripper is aligned with the puck but not near it, move the gripper down to the puck to push it from behind.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push and grip the puck from the back.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we've probably pushed and gripped the puck from behind, now we can slide it backwards to the target location. Keep the gripper closed to ensure we maintain our grip on the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal.
