    Steps:  1. Put gripper above handle  2. Move the gripper to the side of the handle  3. Grab the handle with the gripper  4. Lift the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Next, move the gripper to the side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the gripper is not beside the handle, the robot should move gripper to side of handle.
    Once the gripper is beside the handle, grab the handle.
