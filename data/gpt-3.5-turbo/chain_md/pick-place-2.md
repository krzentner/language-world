To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the puck  2. Grab the puck with the gripper  3. Move the gripper to the target location  4. Release the puck at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above the puck.
    Once the gripper is above the puck, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should put gripper around the puck.
    Once we have the puck in the gripper, we can move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, the robot should move gripper to target location.
    Once the gripper is at the target location, we can release the puck by opening the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the robot's gripper is around the puck, the robot should release the puck at the target location.
