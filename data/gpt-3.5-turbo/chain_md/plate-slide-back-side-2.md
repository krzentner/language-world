The following steps can help the robot slide the plate back sideways into the target location:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Put gripper above the target location  4. Slide the plate back to the target location
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
If the gripper is not around the plate, move it around the plate and close the gripper to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the plate.
Once the gripper has got the plate, it should be moved to put the gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should put gripper above the target location.
Now that the robot's gripper is above the target location, slide the plate back towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the plate is not at the target location, the robot should slide the plate back towards the target location.
