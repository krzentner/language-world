To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put the gripper near the left edge of the plate
2. Push the gripper into the plate to trap it against the surface below
3. Slide the plate back to the target location
4. Release the gripper to let go of the plate

The robot can slide the plate back by trapping it between the gripper and the surface below and then moving the gripper. If the plate is not aligned with the gripper's left edge, move the gripper to that edge before pushing down on the plate to trap it against the surface.

- When the robot's gripper is not near the left edge of the plate, the robot should move the gripper near the left edge of the plate.

Once the gripper is near the left edge of the plate, push it down onto the surface below to trap the plate.

- When the robot's gripper is near the left edge of the plate, the robot should push the gripper into the plate to trap it against the surface below.

Now that the plate is trapped, slide it back to the target location. If the gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, adjust its position and keep sliding.

- When the robot's gripper is trapping the plate, the robot should slide the plate back to the target location.

Finally, release the gripper to let go of the plate at the target location.

- When the plate is at the target location, the robot should release the gripper to let go of the plate.
