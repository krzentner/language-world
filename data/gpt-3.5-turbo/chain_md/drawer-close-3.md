To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above drawer handle.
2. Drop gripper around drawer handle.
3. Push drawer closed.
    
First, put the gripper mostly above the drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the drawer handle, the robot should put the gripper above the drawer handle.

Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, we should be able to grab the handle by moving the gripper down around it.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the drawer handle.

We can push the drawer closed by simply pushing it with the gripper from the sides or top.
- When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed.
