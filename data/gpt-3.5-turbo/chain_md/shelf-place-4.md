To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Lift the block up  4. Move the block to the target location  5. Lower the block to place it at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, the robot should put gripper above block.
    If the gripper is not around the block, grab the block with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the block.
    Once the block is grabbed, lift the block up.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should lift the block up.
    Once the block is lifted, move the block to the target location.
    - Once the block is lifted, the robot should move the block to the target location.
    Once the block is at the target location, lower the block to place it.
    - When the block is at the target location, the robot should lower the block to place it at the target location.
