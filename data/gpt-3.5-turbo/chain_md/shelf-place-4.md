To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Drop gripper around the block  3. Close the gripper around the block  4. Lift the block up  5. Move gripper to target location  6. Lower the block  7. Release the gripper

First, put the gripper above the block so that we can grab it. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
Next, drop the gripper around the block to pick it up. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
Close the gripper around the block once it is around it. 
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
Lift the block up so that it is not touching the surface it was on. 
- When the robot's gripper has closed around the block, the robot should lift the block up.
Move the gripper to the target location. 
- When the gripper has lifted the block up and it needs to move it, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
Lower the block at the target location. 
- Once the gripper has moved to the target location, the robot should lower the block onto it.
Release the gripper to let go of the block. 
- When the block has been placed, the robot should release the gripper.
