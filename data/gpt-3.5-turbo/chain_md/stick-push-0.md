To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- Put gripper above the stick
- Drop gripper around the stick
- Close gripper around the stick
- Line up the stick with the thermos
- Push the thermos to the target location using the stick

First, put the gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should place gripper above the stick.

If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the stick.

If the gripper is near the stick and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the stick.

Once the gripper has the stick, we need to line it up with the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the stick is not in line with the thermos, the robot should line up the stick with the thermos.

Finally, we can push the thermos using the stick.
- When the robot's gripper and the stick are lined up with the thermos and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
