To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the cube  2. Grab the cube with the gripper  3. Lift the cube up slightly  4. Move the gripper to the side of the cube  5. Lower the cube back down  6. slide cube towards the target location
    First, move the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
    Once the gripper is above the cube, we can try to grab it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the cube.
    After grabbing the cube, lift it up slightly so it's not dragging on the surface.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lift the cube up slightly.
    Next, move the gripper to the side of the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the robot's gripper is not to the side of the cube, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the cube.
    Once the gripper is to the side of the cube, lower the cube back down.
    - When the robot's gripper is to the side of the cube and the robot's gripper is holding the cube above the surface, the robot should lower the cube back down onto the surface.
    Finally, slide the cube towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube above the surface and the cube is not at the target location, the robot should slide the cube towards the target location.
