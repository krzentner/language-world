The steps the robot should perform to push the soccer ball into the target location are:

1. Put the gripper above the soccer ball.
2. Grab the soccer ball with the gripper.
3. Move the gripper to the target location.
4. Push the soccer ball towards the target location.
5. If the soccer ball gets stuck or deviates from its course towards the target, adjust the gripper's position and try again.
6. When the soccer ball reaches the target location, release the gripper to drop the ball in the target.
