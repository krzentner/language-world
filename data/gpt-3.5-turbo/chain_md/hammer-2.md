To hit the nail with the hammer, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the hammer above the nail  2. Drop hammer onto the nail  3. Lift the hammer off the nail
    First, put the hammer above the nail. It is important to align the hammer properly with the nail to ensure a successful hit.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the nail, the robot should put the hammer above the nail.
    Once the hammer is aligned above the nail, drop it onto the nail with enough force to drive it in.
    - When the hammer is above the nail and the gripper is closed, the robot should drop the hammer onto the nail.
    After hitting the nail, lift the hammer off the nail to complete the task.
    - When the hammer is on the nail, the robot should lift the hammer off the nail.
