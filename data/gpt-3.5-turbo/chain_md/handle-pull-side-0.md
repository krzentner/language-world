To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle up from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
    If the handle becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the handle. Because the handle is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When handle is not left of the robot's gripper and handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
    As long the gripper is still mostly around the handle and the handle isn't pulled up from the side, pull the handle up from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not pulled up from the side, the robot should pull the handle up from the side.
