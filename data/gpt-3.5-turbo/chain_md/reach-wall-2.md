To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Move gripper to top of wall  2. Move gripper to target location
First, the robot should move the gripper to the top of the wall to see beyond it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the top of the wall.
Once the robot can see beyond the short wall, it can move the gripper directly to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
