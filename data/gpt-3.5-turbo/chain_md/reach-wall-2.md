To reach the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Move the robot's gripper towards the wall, aligning it with the target location 
2. Move the robot's gripper up and over the wall 
3. Move the robot's gripper down towards the target location 
4. Adjust the gripper position as needed to reach the exact location.

We need to start by aligning the gripper with the target location, taking into account the position of the wall. 
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the target location and the target location is blocked by the wall, the robot should move the gripper towards the wall, aligning it with the target location. 

Once the gripper is aligned with the target location, we need to move it up and over the wall to reach the other side. 
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location but blocked by the wall, the robot should move the gripper up and over the wall. 

Once the gripper is on the other side of the wall, we can move it down towards the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall but not at the target location, the robot should move the gripper down towards the target location. 

Depending on the height and thickness of the wall, we may need to adjust the gripper position to reach the exact location. 
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location but not close enough, the robot should adjust the gripper position as needed to reach the exact location.
