To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above stick  2. Grab the stick with the gripper  3. Line up the stick with the thermos  4. Push the thermos with the stick to the goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the stick so that we can grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
    If the gripper isn't around the stick, put it around the stick to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around stick.
    Once we have the stick, we need to line it up with the thermos.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the stick and the stick is not aligned with the thermos, the robot should align the stick with the thermos.
    Once the stick is aligned with the thermos, we can push the thermos using the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed around the stick and the stick is aligned with the thermos, the robot should push thermos with the stick towards the goal.
