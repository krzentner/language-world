The robot should perform the following steps in order to pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Lift the peg out of the hole  4. Move the peg to the target location  5. Release the peg
First, put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
If the peg is still in the hole, the gripper should move down and grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should grab the peg with the gripper.
As long as the peg is still in the hole, lift it out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is still in the hole, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
Move the gripper holding the peg to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and it's not at the target location, the robot should move the peg to the target location.
Once the peg is at the target location, release it.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and it's at the target location, the robot should release the peg.
