To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, the robot should put gripper above wrench handle.
    If the gripper isn't around the wrench, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab wrench.
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, just pull the wrench up and off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench, the robot should pull wrench off the peg.
