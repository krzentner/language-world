To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench up and away from the peg
   First, the robot should position the gripper above the wrench handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle, the robot should put gripper above the wrench handle.
   Once the gripper is above the wrench handle, the robot should try to grab the handle with the gripper.
   - If the wrench is not yet in the gripper, the robot should grab the wrench handle.
   After the wrench is grabbed, the robot should lift it up and away from the peg it was on.
   - When the wrench has been fully lifted and is no longer on the peg, the robot should stop lifting and move the wrench away.
