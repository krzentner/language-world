To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, move the gripper roughly around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around the dial.
    With the gripper around the dial, we can turn the dial to the desired position. We can assume that the robot has some way to detect the current position of the dial and the desired position to turn it to.
    - When the dial is not at the desired position, the robot should turn the dial until it reaches the desired position.
