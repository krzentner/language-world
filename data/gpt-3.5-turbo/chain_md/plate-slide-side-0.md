To reliably slide the plate sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:

1. Put gripper above the plate, centered on the edge facing the goal.
2. Move gripper along the edge of the plate, keeping it centered, until it reaches the center of the plate.
3. Slide the gripper and plate towards the goal until the plate is in the target location and centered. 

If the gripper is not initially centered on the edge of the plate facing the goal, move it to that position. 

- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate with the gripper centered on the edge facing the goal, the robot should move gripper above the plate and center it on the edge facing the goal.

If the gripper is not centered on the plate's edge during sliding, center it while sliding towards the goal.

- When the robot's gripper is sliding towards the goal and is not centered on the edge of the plate, the robot should center the gripper while sliding.

If the plate is not centered in the target location when it reaches it, move it to the center.

- When the plate is in the target location but not centered, the robot should center the plate.
