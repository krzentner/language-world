To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Pull the wrench upwards and away from the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    If the gripper isn't around the wrench, put it around the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around wrench.
    If the gripper is near the wrench and closed, we've probably grabbed it. Try to pull the wrench up and away from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pull the wrench upward and away from the peg.
