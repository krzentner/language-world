To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench handle on the peg  2. Drop gripper around the wrench handle  3. Pull the wrench up and release it from the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench handle on the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench handle on the peg, the robot should put gripper above the wrench handle.
    Once the gripper is above the wrench handle, the gripper should be dropped around the wrench handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wrench handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the wrench handle.
    As long as the gripper is around the wrench handle, it's being pulled up, so keep pulling until it is released from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench handle, the robot should pull the wrench up and release it from the peg.
