To push the soccer ball into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around soccer ball  3. Push the soccer ball towards the target
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, the robot should put gripper above soccer ball.
    Once the gripper is above the soccer ball, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball, the robot should grab the soccer ball.
    If the soccer ball is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push it towards the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the soccer ball, the robot should push the soccer ball towards the target.
