To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up the gripper with the soccer ball about halfway between the center of the ball and the edge.  2. Push the ball toward the goal
    First, the robot should position the gripper so that it's roughly halfway between the center of the ball and the edge, so that it's less likely to accidentally push the ball in the wrong direction. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not lined up with the soccer ball, the robot should line up the gripper with the soccer ball.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the soccer ball, the robot should simply push the ball toward the goal.
