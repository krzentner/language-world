The robot should perform the following steps to reach the target location with a short wall in the way:
    Steps:  1. Position gripper above the wall so that it's close to the target location  2. Lower the gripper to the target location and reach towards it
    First, put the gripper above the wall so that it's close to the target location, but still out of the way of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not positioned above the wall close to the target location, the robot should position gripper above the wall so that it's close to the target location.
    Once the gripper is above the wall and close to the target location, lower the gripper down to the target location and move it towards the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is positioned above the wall close to the target location, the robot should lower the gripper to the target location and reach towards it.
