# Steps:
#  1. Scan the bin to locate the cube
#  2. Put the gripper above the cube
#  3. Grab the cube with the gripper
#  4. Move the cube to the target bin
#  5. Release the cube into the target bin
# First, the robot needs to scan the bin to locate the cube. This can be done through
# a combination of visual recognition and movement planning.
if check("the robot has not scanned the bin to locate the cube"):
    robot.scan("the bin to locate the cube")
    
# Once the cube is located, move the gripper above the cube.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
    robot.move("the gripper above the cube")
    
# Next, grab the cube with the gripper.
if check("the robot's gripper is not holding the cube"):
    robot.grab("the cube")
    
# Now, move the cube to the target bin.
if check("the robot has not moved the cube to the target bin"):
    robot.move("the cube to the target bin")
    
# Finally, release the cube into the target bin.
if check("the cube has not been released into the target bin"):
