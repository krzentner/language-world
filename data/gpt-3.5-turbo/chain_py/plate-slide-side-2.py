# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above one end of the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Move the gripper to align the plate with the target location
    #  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    # Put the gripper above one end of the plate, ensuring that the plate is within
    # reach of the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned and close to one end of the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    # Once the gripper is aligned with one end of the plate, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned and close to one end of the plate and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    # The gripper is holding the plate now, so we can move the gripper to align the
    # plate with the target location. We can only slide the plate sideways, so we
    # need to adjust its position accordingly.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the plate"):
        robot.move("gripper to align plate with target location")
    # Now that the gripper is aligned with the target location and the plate is in
    # the correct orientation, we can slide the plate sideways to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location"):
        robot.slide("plate sideways into the target location")
