# Steps:

#   2. Open gripper and drop it around the peg
#   3. Close gripper around the peg
#   4. Lift the wrench and the peg together
#   5. Place the wrench with the peg into the hole
# First, put the gripper above the wrench.
if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wrench"):

# If the gripper is above the wrench, we can try to drop it around the peg.

# If the wrench is around the peg, we can try to grip it by closing the gripper.

# If we have a good grip on both the wrench and the peg, we can try to lift them together.

# Once we have the wrench and the peg lifted, we can try to place them together into the hole.
