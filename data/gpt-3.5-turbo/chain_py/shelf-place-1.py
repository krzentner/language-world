# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above block
    #  2. Drop gripper around block
    #  3. Close gripper around block
    #  4. Move block to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the block to avoid collisions.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the block"):
        robot.place("gripper above block")
    # If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around block")
    # If the gripper is near the block and open, grab it by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near block and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around block")
    # We closed the gripper, and the block is still near the gripper, so we probably grabbed it.
    # Try to move the block to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above block and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("block at goal on shelf")
