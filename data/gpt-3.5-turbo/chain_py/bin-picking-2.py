# Steps:
    #  1. Identify the cube using a vision system
    #  2. Move the gripper above the cube
    #  3. Lower the gripper to pick up the cube
    #  4. Move the gripper to the target bin
    #  5. Drop the cube into the bin
    # Use the vision system to identify the cube and its position
    if check("the cube has not been identified"):
        robot.see("cube")
    # If the gripper is not above the cube, move it there
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move("gripper above cube")
    # Lower the gripper to pick up the cube
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    # Move the gripper to the target bin
    if check("the cube is grasped by the gripper and the gripper is not above the target bin"):
        robot.move("gripper to target bin")
    # Drop the cube into the bin
    if check("the gripper is above the target bin and it is holding the cube"):
        robot.drop("cube into the bin")
