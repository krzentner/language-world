To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg and the robot's gripper is not above the peg, the robot should put gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should lower the gripper into the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should remove the peg from the hole.
- When the peg is removed from the hole and the robot's gripper is not near the target location, the robot should move gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the peg at the target location.
