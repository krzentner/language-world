To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not above the handle, the robot should move the gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is above the handle, the robot should grip the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle.
