To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put the gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is above the handle, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle.
