To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should put gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should lift the cube.
- When the cube is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is not directly above the bin, the robot should move the gripper above the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the cube is not directly above the bin, the robot should move the cube above the bin.
- When the robot's gripper and the cube are aligned with the target bin, the robot should release the cube into the bin.
