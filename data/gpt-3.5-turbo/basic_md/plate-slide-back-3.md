To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the gripper, the robot should move the gripper above the plate.
- When the gripper is above the plate and the gripper is not around the plate, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
- When the gripper is holding the plate, the robot should move the plate back to the target location.
- When the plate is in front of the target location, the robot should push the plate into the target location.
