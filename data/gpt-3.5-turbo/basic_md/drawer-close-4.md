To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the drawer is open, the robot should move its gripper to the front of the drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the drawer is open, the robot should put its gripper around the drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding onto the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed with the gripper until the drawer is securely closed.
