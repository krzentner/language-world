To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is above the handle and not around the handle, the robot should grab handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle and not near the button, the robot should move the gripper towards the button.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button, the robot should push down on the handle to activate the button.
