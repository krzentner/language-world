To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet knob, the robot should move the gripper to the knob.
- When the robot's gripper is on top of the knob, the robot should grip the knob.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the knob, the robot should turn the knob to the right until the faucet is closed.
- Finally, the robot should release the grip on the knob and move away from the faucet.
