To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the faucet handle, the robot should position the gripper above the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is positioned above the faucet handle and the faucet is not closed, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper has grasped the handle, the robot should turn the handle to the right to close the faucet.
- When the faucet is closed, the robot should release the handle.
