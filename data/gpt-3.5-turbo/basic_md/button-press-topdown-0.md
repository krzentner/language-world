To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should put gripper above the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not near the button, the robot should move the gripper closer to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grip the button between the gripper fingers.
    - When the robot's gripper is gripping the button and the robot's gripper is above the button, the robot should push down on the button until it clicks, and then release the button.
