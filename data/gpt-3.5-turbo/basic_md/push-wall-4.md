To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck to the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wall and the robot's gripper is above the puck, the robot should push the puck against the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is below the top of the wall, the robot should lift the puck over the wall and place it at the goal location.
