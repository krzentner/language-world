To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper and the wall is blocking the path to the goal, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper and the wall is no longer blocking the path to the goal, the robot should slide the puck to the goal.
