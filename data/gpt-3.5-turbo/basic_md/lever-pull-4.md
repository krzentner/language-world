To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the lever, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the lever.
    - When the gripper is nearby the lever, the robot should grip the lever.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the lever and the lever is not pointing upwards, the robot should rotate the lever upwards.
