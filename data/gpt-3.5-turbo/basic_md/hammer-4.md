To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the hammer, the robot should move the gripper close to the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the hammer, the robot should grip the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the robot's gripper is not near the nail, the robot should move the hammer close to the nail.
- When the robot's gripper holding the hammer is near the nail, the robot should align the hammer head with the nail head.
- When the hammer head is aligned with the nail head, the robot should swing the hammer and hit the nail head with the hammer head.
- When the nail is successfully hit, the robot should release the grip of the hammer and move the gripper away from the hammer and the nail.
