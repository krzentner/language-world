To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, the robot should put the gripper above the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the robot is not above the nail, the robot should move the hammer above the nail.
- When the hammer is above the nail, the robot should swing the hammer down onto the nail.
- When the hammer hits the nail, the robot should release the grip and move the gripper away from the hammer and the nail.
