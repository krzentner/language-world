To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal. The robot should push the puck with a force that is less than what would be required to push the puck forward.
