To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not holding the hammer, the robot should align the gripper with the hammer's handle and grasp the handle securely.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer, the robot should align the hammer with the nail such that the hammer's head is directly above the nail.
- When the hammer's head is above the nail, the robot should swing the hammer down towards the nail.
- When the hammer's head makes contact with the nail, the robot should stop the hammer's motion and release the hammer's handle.
