To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the robot is holding the stick and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the thermos, the robot should put the gripper above the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is above the thermos and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the thermos.
- When the robot is holding the thermos and the robot's gripper is still around the stick, the robot should move the stick to the side of the thermos.
- When the robot has moved the stick to the side of the thermos, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the goal.
- When the thermos has reached the goal, the robot should release the thermos and the stick.
