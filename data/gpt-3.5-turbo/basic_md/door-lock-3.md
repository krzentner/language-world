To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should reach and position the gripper near the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the dial is not in the correct position, the robot should grasp the dial.
- When the dial is grasped by the robot's gripper, the robot should turn the dial to the correct combination.
- When the correct combination is set, the robot should release the dial and move the gripper away from the dial.
