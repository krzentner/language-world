To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the cube, the robot should move gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the gripper is not around the cube, the robot should grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location and the gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the cube at the target location.
