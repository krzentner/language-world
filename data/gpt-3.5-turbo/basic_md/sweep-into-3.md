To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably for the task `sweep-into`, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the cube towards the target location while maintaining a firm grip on the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the cube to place it at the target location.
