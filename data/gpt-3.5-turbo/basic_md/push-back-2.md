To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not behind the puck, the robot should move the gripper behind the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is behind the puck and the robot's gripper is not touching the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal while keeping the gripper closed.
