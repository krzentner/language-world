To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the robot's gripper, the robot should push the puck backwards towards the goal location.
