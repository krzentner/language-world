To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should position the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the mug, the robot should close the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug, the robot should lift the mug off the table.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is not yet there, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location while holding the mug.
- When the mug is at the target location, the robot should carefully place the mug down. Finally, the robot should open the gripper to release the mug.
