To reach the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, the robot should move its arm towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should extend its arm to reach the target location.
    - When the robot's arm is extended and in the correct position, the robot should hold its position to maintain the reach.
