To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg and the gripper is open, the robot should move gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the peg and the peg is aligned with the hole, the robot should push the peg into the hole from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is released from the peg and the peg is inserted into the hole, the robot should move away from the hole.
