To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around faucet handle, the robot should put gripper around faucet handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle left until water is flowing.
