To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the dial is not in the correct position, the robot should turn the dial to the desired position by rotating the gripper. This may require multiple rotations depending on the desired position.
- When the dial is in the correct position, the robot should release the gripper.
