To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push the puck towards the target location.
- When the puck is near the target location, the robot should adjust the position and angle of the puck using its gripper until it reaches the target location.
