To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper above faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, the robot should apply force to turn the handle right.
- When the faucet is completely closed, the robot's gripper should release the handle.
