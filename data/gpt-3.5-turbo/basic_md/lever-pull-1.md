To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should put gripper above the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is not near the lever, the robot should move gripper near the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is near the lever and the lever is below the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever, the robot should rotate the lever up.
- When the lever has been rotated up, the robot should release the lever and move away.
