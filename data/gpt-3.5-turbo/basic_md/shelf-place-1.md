To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
  - When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower the gripper to hold the block.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the gripper is not vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper to be vertically aligned with the target location.
  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should release the block to place it at the target location.
