To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably for the task `shelf-place`, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should position the gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower the gripper to grasp the block.
- When the robot's gripper is grasping the block and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the shelf, the robot should move the gripper to align with the target shelf.
- When the gripper is aligned with the target shelf and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place the block on the shelf.
