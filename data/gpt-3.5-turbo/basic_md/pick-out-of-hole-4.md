To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the hole and peg, the robot should move the gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should release the peg.
