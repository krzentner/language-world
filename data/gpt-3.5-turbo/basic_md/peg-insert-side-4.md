To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should reach to the location of the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should lift the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the peg is at the same height as the hole, the robot should move gripper to the side of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is in alignment with the hole, the robot should insert the peg into the hole.
- When the peg is fully inserted into the hole, the robot should release the gripper and move away.
