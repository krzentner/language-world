To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hole and the gripper is not closed, the robot should move the gripper above the hole and close the gripper.
- When the gripper is around the peg and the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should move the gripper and peg to be above the hole.
- When the peg is vertically aligned with the hole and the gripper is above the hole, the robot should open the gripper to release the peg.
- When the gripper is above the target location, the robot should close the gripper to grab the peg again.
- Finally, when the gripper is above the goal and the gripper is closed, the robot should release the peg at the target location.
