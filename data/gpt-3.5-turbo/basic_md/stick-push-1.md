To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should close gripper around the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the thermos and the stick is not aligned with the thermos, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos until it is aligned with it.
    - When the stick is aligned with the thermos and the robot's gripper is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal using the stick.
    - When the thermos reaches the goal, the robot should release the stick and open the gripper to drop it.
