To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not located close to the stick, the robot should move towards the stick and grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not positioned above the thermos, the robot should position the gripper above the thermos.
- When the gripper is positioned above the thermos and the stick is near the thermos, the robot should push the thermos to the target location using the stick.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the stick from its gripper.
