To reach the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot is not already positioned near the target location, it should move towards the target location.
- When the robot is close to the target location, it should position its gripper to grasp or manipulate the target object.
- When the robot has successfully grasped or manipulated the target object, it should carefully move the object to the desired location while avoiding obstacles or collisions.
- Once the robot has arrived at the target location, it should release the object or perform any necessary actions at the location, such as flipping a switch or pressing a button.
