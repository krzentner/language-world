To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should position the gripper above the handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is holding the handle, the robot should pull the handle up.
