To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is below the handle, the robot should move gripper to above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should drop gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull the handle up.
