To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably for the `coffee-push` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug and the mug is not above the robot's gripper, the robot should put the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is not near the mug, the robot should move the gripper towards the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grasp the mug handle.
- When the robot has grasped the mug handle, it should move the arm to lift the mug.
- When the mug is lifted, the robot should move it to the target location by adjusting the distance and orientation of the gripper.
- Finally, when the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the mug by opening the gripper, and then retreat the arm.
