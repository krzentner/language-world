To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the gripper is not above the mug, the robot should move the gripper above the mug.
   - When the gripper is above the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
   - When the gripper is holding the mug and the mug is not near the target location, the robot should move the gripper and mug to the target location.
   - When the gripper and mug are at the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the mug.
