To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should reach the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not below the handle, the robot should align the gripper with the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull the handle up.
