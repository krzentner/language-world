To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the dial, the robot should position gripper above the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the desired direction.
- When the robot reaches the desired position, the robot should release the dial by opening the gripper.
