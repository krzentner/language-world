To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost horizontally aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper to the left of the dial.
    - When the gripper is in position, the robot should close gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the dial, the robot should turn the dial by rotating the gripper in the necessary direction until the desired position is reached.
    - When the dial is correctly positioned, the robot should release the gripper.
