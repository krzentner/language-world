To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper to the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the dial and the dial is not at the correct position, the robot should turn the dial in the correct direction until it reaches the desired position.
