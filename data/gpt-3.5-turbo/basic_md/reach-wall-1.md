To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near reach target and the robot's gripper is not blocked by the wall, the robot should reach to goal.
- When the robot's gripper is blocked by the wall, the robot should move to a position to the side of the wall where there is no obstruction.
- When the robot is in a position where there is no obstruction to the target location, the robot should reach to the goal.
