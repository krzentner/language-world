To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper to the left of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not between the robot and the goal, the robot should move the plate to be between the robot and the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is between the robot and the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate back sideways into the target location.
