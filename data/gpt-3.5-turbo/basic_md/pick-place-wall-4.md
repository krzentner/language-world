To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the wall is blocking a straight path to the puck, the robot should move to a location where there is a clear path to the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and there is a clear path to the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the wall is blocking a straight path to the target location, the robot should move to a location where there is a clear path to the target location.
