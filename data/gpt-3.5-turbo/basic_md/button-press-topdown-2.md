To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should place the gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, the robot should move the gripper down to touch the button.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should apply pressure to push the button down.
- When the button is pushed down, the robot should release the pressure and lift the gripper away from the button.
