To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the block at the target location.
