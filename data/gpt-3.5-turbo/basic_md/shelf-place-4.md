To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, the robot should put gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should raise the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper horizontally to align with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should release the block by opening the gripper and then lower the gripper to place the block at the target location.
