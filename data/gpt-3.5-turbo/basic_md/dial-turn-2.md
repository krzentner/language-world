To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put the gripper above the dial.
   - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put the gripper around the dial.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn it to the desired number or position.
