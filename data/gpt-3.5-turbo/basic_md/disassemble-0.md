To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
- When the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and wrench is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench straight up to remove it from the peg.
