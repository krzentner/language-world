To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and not near the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick and move towards it.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the thermos and the stick is not yet touching the thermos, the robot should move the stick closer to the thermos.
- When the stick is touching the thermos, the robot should push the thermos towards the goal, using the stick as a lever.
- When the thermos reaches the goal, the robot should release the stick and drop the thermos at the goal.
