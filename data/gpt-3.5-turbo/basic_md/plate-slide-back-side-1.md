To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not on the side of the plate, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is on the side of the plate, the robot should open the gripper and grab onto the plate.
- When the robot's gripper has a good grip on the plate, the robot should slide the plate sideways towards the target location.
- When the plate has reached the target location, the robot should release the plate by opening the gripper.
