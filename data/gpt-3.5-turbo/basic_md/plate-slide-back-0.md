To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper to the left of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the gripper is not around the plate, the robot should grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not against the target location, the robot should slide the plate back towards the target location.
- When the plate is against the target location, the robot should release the plate and move the gripper away.
