To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not against the edge of the target location, the robot should slide the plate back.
   - When the plate is against the edge of the target location, the robot should gently push the plate to its final position.
