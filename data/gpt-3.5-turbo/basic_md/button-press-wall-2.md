To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper in front of the button, but not too close to the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button, the robot should tilt gripper towards the button while moving closer.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should push the button while keeping the gripper tilted towards the button. If the gripper is too wide, the robot should move back slightly to avoid hitting the wall.
