To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not in contact with the wall, the robot should move gripper towards the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is against the wall, the robot should move gripper down until it reaches the button.
- When the robot's gripper is on top of the button, the robot should push down on the button.
