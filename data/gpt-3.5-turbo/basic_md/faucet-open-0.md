To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle left until water flows.
