To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should put gripper around mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, the robot should pull mug towards target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should release the mug.
