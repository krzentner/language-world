To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should grab the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle to the left to open the faucet.
