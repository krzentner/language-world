To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around peg.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not aligned with the hole, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
   - When the peg is aligned with the hole and the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole and away from the board.
