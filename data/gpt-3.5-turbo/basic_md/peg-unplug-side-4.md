To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the peg is not pulled out of the hole, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not pulled out of the hole, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole laterally.
- When the peg is pulled out of the hole, the robot should release the peg.
