To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube and the cube is not in the target bin, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the cube is not in the target bin, the robot should grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target bin, the robot should move the gripper above the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target bin and the cube is not yet inside the bin, the robot should place the cube inside the bin.
- When the cube is inside the bin, the robot should release its grip on the cube and move away from the bin.
