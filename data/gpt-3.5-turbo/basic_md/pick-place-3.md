To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should grab the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the puck is not on the target location, the robot should release the puck onto the target location.
