To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should reach for the handle.
  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should grasp the handle.
  - When the robot's gripper is grasping the handle, the robot should turn the handle to the right until it stops.
  - When the faucet handle is fully turned to the right, the robot should release the handle.
