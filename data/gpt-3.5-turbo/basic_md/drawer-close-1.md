To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move the gripper to the drawer handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed.
