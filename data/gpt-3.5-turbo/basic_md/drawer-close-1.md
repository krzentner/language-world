To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer and the drawer is not fully closed, the robot should move gripper closer to the drawer.
- When the robot's gripper is near the drawer and the drawer is not fully closed, the robot should push the drawer closed. 
- When the drawer is fully closed, the robot should release the gripper.
