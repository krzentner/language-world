To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg and the gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should move gripper above peg.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move the gripper towards the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the gripper is closed, the robot should lift the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hole and the gripper is open, the robot should lower the peg into the hole.
- When the peg is in the hole, the robot should release the peg and move the gripper away.
