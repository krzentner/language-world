To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should put gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball and the robot's gripper is above the hoop, the robot should align the ball with the hoop.
- When the ball is aligned with the hoop, the robot should push the ball through the hoop.
