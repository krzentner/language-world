To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, the robot should move gripper to the left of window handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window right.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push window right harder.
