To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the plate is not aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and not holding it, the robot should hold the plate from either side.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should move the gripper sideways away from the target location.
- When the gripper is near the target location and the gripper is holding the plate, the robot should move the gripper backwards to slide the plate into the target location.
