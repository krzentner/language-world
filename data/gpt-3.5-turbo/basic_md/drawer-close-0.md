To push the drawer closed reliably, the robot should perform the following steps: 
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move the gripper towards the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle and the drawer is not closed, the robot should push the drawer closed.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed harder if needed.
