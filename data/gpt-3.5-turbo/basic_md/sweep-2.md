To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the cube is gripped and the gripper is closed, the robot should move the gripper and cube towards the target location sideways.
- When the robot's gripper reaches the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
