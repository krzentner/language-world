To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move the cube sideways towards the target location.
- When the cube is at the target location, the robot should release the gripper and place the cube at the target location.
