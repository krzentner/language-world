To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper to a position above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is not blocking the gripper's movement, the robot should push down on the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the wall is blocking the gripper's movement, the robot should move gripper to the side of the wall and diagonally align it with the button.
- When the gripper is diagonally aligned with the button, the robot should move the gripper over the button and push it down.
