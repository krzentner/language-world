To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the plate is not aligned with the gripper, the robot should move gripper to one side of the plate.
- When the gripper is above the plate and open, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
- When the gripper is closed around the plate, the robot should move the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate is near the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
