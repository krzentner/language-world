To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the plate is not aligned with the gripper, the robot should align the gripper with the plate.
    - When the gripper is not around the plate, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
    - When the plate is not aligned with the goal, the robot should move the plate to the goal.
    - When the plate is aligned with the goal, the robot should slide the plate into the goal sideways while keeping it parallel to the ground.
