To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not beside the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should align the gripper beside the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is beside the plate and the gripper is not above the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location and the gripper is not beside the target location, the robot should slide the plate sideways into the target location.
