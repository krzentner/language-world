- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the plate but above it, the robot should move gripper to the left side of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate but not aligned with the target location, the robot should push the plate sideways using the gripper to align it with the target location.
- When the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot should push the plate into the target location using the gripper.
