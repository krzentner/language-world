To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the handle and the handle is above the gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the handle and the handle is not pressed, the robot should push the gripper down onto the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is pressed onto the handle, the robot should push the handle down to complete the task.
