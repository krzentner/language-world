When performing the task `reach`, the robot should implement the following steps:
- Check if the robot's gripper is near the target location. If the gripper is not close to the target location, then move the robot's gripper towards the target location until it is close to the target location. 
- Once the gripper is close to the target location, the robot should stop moving and the task is completed.
