To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is in close proximity to the target location, the robot should be careful not to knock over any nearby objects or obstacles.
- When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should maintain a stable position and wait for further instructions.
