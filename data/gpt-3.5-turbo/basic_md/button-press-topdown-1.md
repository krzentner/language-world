To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should place the gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button, the robot should move the gripper down towards the button.
- When the robot's gripper is in contact with the button, the robot should push down on the button to activate it.
- When the button has been pressed, the robot should move its gripper away from the button.
