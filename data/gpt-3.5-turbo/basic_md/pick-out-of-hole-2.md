To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg in the hole, the robot should move the gripper above the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg in the hole and the gripper is not closed, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the robot's gripper is not above target location, the robot should move the gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above target location and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the peg.
