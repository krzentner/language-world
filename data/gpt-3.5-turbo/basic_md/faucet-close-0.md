To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should turn the handle clockwise until it stops.
- When the handle is fully closed, the robot should release the gripper.
