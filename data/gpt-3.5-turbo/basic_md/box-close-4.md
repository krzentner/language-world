To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the box lid off the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is held by the gripper, the robot should move the gripper over the box.
- When the robot's gripper is over the box, the robot should align the box lid with the box and then place the box lid on top of the box.
- When the grip is released, the box lid should remain on top of the box.
