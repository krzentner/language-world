To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put the gripper above the stick.
  - When the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should grab the stick.
  - When the robot's gripper is aligned with the center of the thermos, and the robot's gripper is not holding the thermos, the robot should put the gripper around the thermos.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the thermos and stick, the robot should push the thermos to the target location using the stick.
