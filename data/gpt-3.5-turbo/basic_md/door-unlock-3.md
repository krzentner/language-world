To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door dial, the robot should move to be in front of the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the dial, the robot should grip the dial with its gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the dial, turn the dial in the correct direction by a specified angle or until the lock clicks.
- When the lock clicks or the dial has turned the necessary amount, release the gripper to let go of the dial.
