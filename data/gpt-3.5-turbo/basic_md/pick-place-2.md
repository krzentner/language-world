To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should grab the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, the robot should lift the gripper and move it towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should release the puck and move the gripper away from the puck. The gripper should remain open in case it needs to pick up something else.
