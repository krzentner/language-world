To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
