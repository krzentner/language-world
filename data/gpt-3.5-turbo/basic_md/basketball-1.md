To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball and the robot's gripper is not around the ball, the robot should drop gripper around ball.
- When the robot's gripper is around the ball, the robot should lift the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the ball is vertically aligned with the hoop, the robot should release the ball and let it drop into the hoop.
