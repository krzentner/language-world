To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the coffee machine button, the robot should move gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the button.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the button and the robot is near the coffee machine, the robot should push the button. 
- After the button is pushed, the robot should open the gripper and move away from the coffee machine.
