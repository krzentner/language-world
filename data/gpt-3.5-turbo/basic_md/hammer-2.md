To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the hammer, the robot should put the gripper above the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the hammer and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should pick up the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the hammer and the hammer is not almost vertically aligned with the nail, the robot should move the hammer towards the nail until they are almost aligned.
- When the hammer is almost vertically aligned with the nail and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should swing the hammer towards the nail with enough force to drive the nail into the surface.
