To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put the gripper above the faucet handle.
  - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should grab the faucet handle.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the handle, the robot should turn it to the left until the faucet is open.
