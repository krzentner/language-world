To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should put gripper above the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should release the grip and turn the handle left.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the water flow has increased, the robot should stop turning.
