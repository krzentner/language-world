To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should move gripper above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall but not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button.
- If the robot encounters the wall while moving the gripper, it should move the gripper to the side of the wall and then move it up or down to reach the button. Alternatively, if the robot has sensors that can detect the wall, it can use them to plan a path around the wall.
