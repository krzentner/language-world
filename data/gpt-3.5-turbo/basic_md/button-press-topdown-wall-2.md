To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is further away from the button than the height of the wall, the robot should put the gripper above the wall in line with the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall in line with the button, the robot should move the gripper down to be vertically aligned with the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button.
