To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube securely, the robot should lift the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target bin, the robot should move the gripper to the top of the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target bin and the gripper is open, the robot should release the cube into the bin.
