To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should move gripper around plate from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is around plate and the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate sideways into the target location.
- When the plate is in the target location, the robot should release the plate by opening the gripper.
