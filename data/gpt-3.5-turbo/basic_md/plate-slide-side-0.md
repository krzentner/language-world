To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper closer to the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate, the robot should slide the plate sideways towards the target location.
