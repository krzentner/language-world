To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with button, the robot should move gripper to be aligned with button.
- When the robot's gripper is behind the wall and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should approach the wall slowly until the gripper is near the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wall, the robot should push the gripper against the wall and slide it along the wall until the gripper is above the button.
- When the gripper is above the button, the robot should push down on the button.
