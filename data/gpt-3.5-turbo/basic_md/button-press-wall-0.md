To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is below the wall height, the robot should raise its gripper to the height above the wall and horizontal to the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button, the robot should move forward until it is appropriately aligned.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button with its gripper.
