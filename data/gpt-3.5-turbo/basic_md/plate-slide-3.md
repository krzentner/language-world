To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near plate, the robot should grab the plate handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate handle, the robot should slide the plate into the target location. 
- When the plate is in the target location, the robot should release the plate handle.
