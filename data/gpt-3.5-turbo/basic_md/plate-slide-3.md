To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move the gripper to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location.
