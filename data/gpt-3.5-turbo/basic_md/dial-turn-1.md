To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the desired direction.
    - When the desired position on the dial is reached, the robot should release the dial.
