To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above dial.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
- When the robot has a firm grasp on the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the desired direction.
- Once the dial has been turned to the desired position, the robot should release its grip on the dial.
