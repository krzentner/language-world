To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is securely holding the cube, the robot should move sideways to the target location while keeping the gripper closed around the cube.
- When the robot reaches the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the cube.
