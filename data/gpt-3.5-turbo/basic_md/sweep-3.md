To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should put the gripper around the cube.
- Once the grip is established, the robot should move the cube laterally towards the goal position.
- When the cube is near the goal position, the robot should release the grip and place the cube at the goal position.
