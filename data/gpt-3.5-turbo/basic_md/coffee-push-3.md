To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug and the gripper is not around the handle of the mug, the robot should put gripper above the mug and align its gripper with the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the mug handle, the robot should close its gripper around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should move its gripper to the target location while keeping the mug level and avoiding any spills or collisions.
- When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should place the mug down gently and open its gripper to release the mug.
