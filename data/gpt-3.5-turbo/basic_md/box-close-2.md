To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the box lid, the robot should reach to the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid and the robot's gripper is positioned above the box, the robot should release the box lid onto the box.
