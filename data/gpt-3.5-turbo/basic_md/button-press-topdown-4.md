To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should place gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not around the button, the robot should grab button.
- When the robot's gripper is around the button, the robot should push down on the button. 
- When the button is pressed down, the robot should release the button and move its gripper away from the button.
