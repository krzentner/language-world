To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the cube is not above the target bin, the robot should lift the cube up.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, the robot should lower the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target bin and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should release the cube into the bin.
