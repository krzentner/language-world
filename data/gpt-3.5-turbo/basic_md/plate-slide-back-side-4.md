To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not in front of the gripper, the robot should move the gripper above the plate and position it at the side of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
