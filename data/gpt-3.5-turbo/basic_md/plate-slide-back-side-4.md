To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
- When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate sideways towards the target location.
- When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should stop sliding the plate and release the plate from the gripper.
