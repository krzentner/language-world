- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is around handle and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the direction of the handle, the robot should align the gripper with the direction of the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the direction of the handle, the robot should push down on the handle from the side.
