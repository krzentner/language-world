To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When handle is not left of the robot's gripper and handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not horizontally aligned with target, the robot should align handle to target.
- When handle is horizontally aligned with target, the robot should push down on the handle.
