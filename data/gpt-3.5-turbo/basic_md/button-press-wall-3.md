To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the button, the robot should move the gripper to be in front of the button and right up against the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the button and gripper fingers are open, the robot should close the gripper fingers to push against the button with the gripper. 
- When the robot's gripper is pushing against the button with the fingers closed, the robot should release the gripper fingers to release the button.
