To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, the robot should put gripper above button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and there is a wall in front of the robot, the robot should move closer to the wall until the gripper can reach the button without hitting the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the button and there is a wall in front of the robot, the robot should push the button with enough force to overcome the resistance of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the button and there is no wall in front of the robot, the robot should push the button with a gentle force.
