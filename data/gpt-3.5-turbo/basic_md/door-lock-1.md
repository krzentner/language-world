To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper near the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial, the robot should turn the dial clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct combination.
- When the dial reaches the correct combination, the robot should stop turning and release the dial.
