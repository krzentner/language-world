To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not close to the wall, the robot should move towards the wall.
- When the robot's sensors detect the wall, the robot should move along the wall until it reaches the goal location.
- If the robot encounters any obstacle while moving along the wall towards the goal, it should move away from the wall and try to navigate around the obstacle to reach the goal location.
