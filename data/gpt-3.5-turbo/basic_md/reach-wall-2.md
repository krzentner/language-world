To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near reach target and the robot detects a wall in the way, the robot should move towards the wall.
- When the robot reaches the wall, the robot should adjust its gripper to be above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should reach towards the goal and move the gripper down towards the target location.
- When the gripper is near the target location, the robot should release it.
