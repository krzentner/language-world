To grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should place gripper above the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should move gripper towards the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should wrap the wrench around the peg.
- When the wrench is wrapped around the peg, the robot should tighten the wrench to secure the peg.
