To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the button is not in front of the robot's gripper, the robot should move closer to the button.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the button and not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should align the gripper with the button.
- When the gripper is aligned with the button, the robot should push the button forward.
