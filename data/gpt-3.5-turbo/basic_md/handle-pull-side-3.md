To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put the gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not to the left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is in a lowered position, the robot should pull up on the handle while maintaining grip with the gripper. 
- When the handle is raised, the robot should release the gripper and place the gripper away from the handle.
