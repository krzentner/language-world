To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the lever handle and the lever handle is down, the robot should move the gripper to the lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the lever handle and the lever handle is down, the robot should grab the lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, the robot should rotate the lever up to its uppermost position.
