To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the lever, the robot should move gripper above lever.
- When the robot's gripper is above the lever, the robot should grasp the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is grasping the lever, the robot should pull upwards on the lever to rotate it up.
