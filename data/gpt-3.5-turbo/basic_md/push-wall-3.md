To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck towards the wall until the puck touches the wall.
- Once the puck is touching the wall, the robot should turn the gripper so that it is in the same plane as the wall and the puck.
- The robot should then push the puck along the wall until it reaches the goal location.
