To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is below the stick, the robot should move gripper to right of stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the stick, the robot should grab the stick.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
    - When the stick is near enough to the thermos, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the goal. 
    - When the thermos reaches the goal, the robot should release the stick and remove the gripper from the stick.
