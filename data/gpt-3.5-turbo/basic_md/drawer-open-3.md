To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should grab drawer handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull the handle towards itself until the drawer is fully open.
