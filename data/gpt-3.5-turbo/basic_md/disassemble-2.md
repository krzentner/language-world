To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
- When the gripper is not around wrench and the wrench is not left of the gripper and the wrench is not forward aligned with the gripper, the robot should grab the wrench.
- When the gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is attached to the peg, the robot should pull the wrench away from the peg.
- When the wrench is released from the peg, the robot should move away with the wrench gripped.
