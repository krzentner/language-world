To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, the robot should position the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the handle is not already gripped, the robot should grip the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper has a secure grip on the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle with enough force to fully open it.
