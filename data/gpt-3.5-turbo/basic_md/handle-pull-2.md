To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move the gripper towards the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is grasping the handle, the robot should pull it upwards.
