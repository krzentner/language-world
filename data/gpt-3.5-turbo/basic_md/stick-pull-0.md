To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and the stick is not near the robot, the robot should move gripper to the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the stick, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the thermos, the robot should insert the stick through the handle of the thermos.
- When the stick is through the handle of the thermos, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos toward the goal. 
- When the robot has reached the goal, the robot should remove the stick from the handle of the thermos.
