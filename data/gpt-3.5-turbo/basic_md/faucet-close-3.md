To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move its gripper towards the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the faucet handle, the robot should grip the handle firmly.
- When the robot's gripper has a firm grip on the handle, the robot should turn the handle right until the faucet is closed.
- Finally, the robot should release its grip on the faucet handle.
