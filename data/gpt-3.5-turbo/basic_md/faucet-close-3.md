To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet knob, the robot should move gripper to the faucet knob.
- When the robot's gripper is at the faucet knob and the faucet knob is in the open position, the robot should grab the knob.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the knob and the knob is not in the fully closed position, the robot should turn the knob to the right until it is fully closed.
- When the knob is fully closed, the robot should release the knob with its gripper.
