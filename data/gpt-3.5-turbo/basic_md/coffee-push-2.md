To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the mug is lifted off the table, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the mug and let it settle gently at the target location.
