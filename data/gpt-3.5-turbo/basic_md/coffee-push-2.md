To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably in the `coffee-push` task, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle of the mug, the robot should put the gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle of the mug and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug by the handle and the mug is not above the target location, the robot should lift the mug.
- When the mug is above the target location, the robot should move the gripper and the mug towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the mug to the target location and release the grip on it.
