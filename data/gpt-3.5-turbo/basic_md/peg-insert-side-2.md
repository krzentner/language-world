To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should reach and move gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the gripper is open and aligned with the peg, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
- The robot should lift the peg and align the peg with the hole from the side.
- The robot should insert the peg into the hole.
- Finally, the robot should release the peg from the gripper.
