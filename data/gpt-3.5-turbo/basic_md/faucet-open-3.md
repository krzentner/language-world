To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move closer to the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should turn the handle to the left until water begins to flow.
- If the handle is difficult to turn or the water does not flow, the robot should adjust its grip on the handle and try again until successful.
