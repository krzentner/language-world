To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, the robot should put gripper around the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate, the robot should slide the plate to the target location.
- When the plate reaches the target location, the robot should release the plate by opening the gripper.
