To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, the robot should put gripper above hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the handle of the hammer, the robot should close the gripper around the handle of the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is not aligned with the nail, the robot should move the hammer to be above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is directly above the nail, the robot should swing the hammer down to hit the nail.
