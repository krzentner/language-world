To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should put the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should grab the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the handle of the mug and the mug is not at the target location, the robot should pull the mug towards the target location.
- When the mug reaches the target location, the robot should release the mug by opening the gripper.
