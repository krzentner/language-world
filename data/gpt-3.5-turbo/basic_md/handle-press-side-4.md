To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, the robot should move to the side of the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned horizontally with the handle, the robot should put the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should apply pressure to push down the handle.
