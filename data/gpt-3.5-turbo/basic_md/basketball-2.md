To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball and the robot's gripper is not around the ball, the robot should push the gripper into the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the ball and the ball is below the hoop, the robot should move the gripper and ball to the hoop.
    - When the ball is below the hoop and the robot's gripper is near the hoop, the robot should release the ball and let it fall into the hoop.
