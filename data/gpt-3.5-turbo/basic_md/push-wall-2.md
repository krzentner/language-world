To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push the puck until it reaches the wall.
- When the puck reaches the wall, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the puck opposite the wall.
- The robot should push the puck towards the goal again.
- If the puck hits the wall again, the robot should repeat the previous two steps until the puck reaches the goal.
