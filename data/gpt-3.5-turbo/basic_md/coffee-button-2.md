To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the coffee machine's button, the robot should move gripper to the location above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button, the robot should push the button down. The pressure needed may vary depending on the type of button.
