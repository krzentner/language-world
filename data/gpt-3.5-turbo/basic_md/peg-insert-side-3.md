To grab the peg and insert it into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should approach the peg from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and the peg is aligned with the hole, the robot should insert the peg into the hole from the side until it is fully inserted.
- When the peg is fully inserted, the robot should release the gripper and move away from the peg and hole.
