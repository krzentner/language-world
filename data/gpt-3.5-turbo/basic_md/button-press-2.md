To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper in front of the button.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, the robot should move the gripper closer to the button.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should push the button.
