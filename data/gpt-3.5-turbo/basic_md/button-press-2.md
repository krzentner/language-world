To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button horizontally and the button is not too high, the robot should move gripper to align with the button horizontally.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the button horizontally and the robot's gripper is not around the button, the robot should move the gripper towards the button.
- When the robot's gripper is around the button, the robot should push the button with its gripper.
