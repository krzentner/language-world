To grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should move the gripper above the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not around wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is around wrench, the robot should close the gripper around wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should move the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should move the gripper to align the wrench with the peg.
- When the wrench is aligned with the peg, the robot should wrap the wrench around the peg.
- When the wrench is wrapped around the peg, the robot should loosen or tighten the wrench based on the requirement of the assembly.
