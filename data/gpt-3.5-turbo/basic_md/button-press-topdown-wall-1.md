  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is below the height of the wall, the robot should lift gripper above the wall.
  - When the robot's gripper is above the height of the wall and not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper above the button.
  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper down to touch the button and then press down on the button.
