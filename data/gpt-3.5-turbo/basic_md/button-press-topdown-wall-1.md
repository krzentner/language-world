To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not around the button, the robot should put the gripper around the button.
- When the robot's gripper is around the button and the robot's gripper is not below the wall, the robot should lift the gripper and button up above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper and button are above the wall, the robot should push down on the button to activate it.
- When the button is no longer being pressed, the robot should lift the gripper and button back up over the wall and release the button.
