To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball, the robot should move the gripper towards the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is near the hoop, the robot should release the ball into the hoop.
