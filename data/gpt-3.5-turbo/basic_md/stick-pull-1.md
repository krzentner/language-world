To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should approach the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the stick is not inside the gripper, the robot should open the gripper and grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is near the thermos, the robot should position the stick so that it can be inserted into the handle of the thermos.
- When the stick is inserted into the handle of the thermos, the robot should grab the stick firmly.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick securely, the robot should pull the thermos towards the target location.
- When the thermos reaches the target location, the robot should release the stick and place the thermos at the goal.
