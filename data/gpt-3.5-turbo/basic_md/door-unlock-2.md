To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper to be in front of the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should close the gripper around the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the specified direction until the lock is released.
- When the door is unlocked, the robot should release the dial and open the door if required.
