To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push the puck towards the wall. 
- When the puck hits the wall, the robot should rotate the gripper and push the puck against the wall.
- Once the puck has moved past the wall, the robot should rotate the gripper back and continue pushing the puck towards the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should slow down and gently release the puck at the goal.
