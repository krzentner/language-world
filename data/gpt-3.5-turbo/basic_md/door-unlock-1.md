To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper near the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is not holding the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the required direction until the door unlocks.
