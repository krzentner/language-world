To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, the robot should move gripper to right of window handle.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, the robot should slide window left.
   - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should pull window left harder.
