To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the window handle and below the window handle. If not, move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
2. When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, start sliding the window to the left.
3. If the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle and the window hasn't fully opened, push harder to slide the window fully open.
