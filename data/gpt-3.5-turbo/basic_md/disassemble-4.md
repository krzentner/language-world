To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench upward and away from the peg.
