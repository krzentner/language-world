To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block and the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should move gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block and the robot's gripper is not around the block, the robot should drop gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the block and place it at the target location.
