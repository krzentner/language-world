To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
- When the gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
- When the peg is out of the hole, the robot should move the peg away from the hole.
