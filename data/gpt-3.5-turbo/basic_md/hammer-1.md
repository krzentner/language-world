To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not holding the hammer, the robot should pick up the hammer.
- When the hammer is not above the nail, the robot should position the hammer above the nail.
- When the hammer is positioned above the nail, the robot should swing the hammer to hit the nail.
- After hitting the nail, the robot should release the hammer and move away from the workspace.
