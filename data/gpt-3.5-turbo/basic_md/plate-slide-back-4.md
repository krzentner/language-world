To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not already at the goal, the robot should pull the plate towards the goal.
    - When the plate is at the goal, the robot should release the plate by opening the gripper.
