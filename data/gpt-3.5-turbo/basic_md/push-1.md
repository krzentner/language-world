To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should move gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should push the puck towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the target location and the puck has reached the target location, the robot should release the puck from the gripper.
