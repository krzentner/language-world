To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should put gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should lift it slightly off the ground.
- When the robot's gripper is clear of the ground, the robot should move towards the target location.
- When the robot arrives at the target location, the robot should lower the cube to the ground.
- When the robot's gripper is clear of the cube, the robot should release its grip on the cube.
