To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the plate is not in front of the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper to the left of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above and near the plate, the robot should place gripper on top of the plate.
- When the plate is below and in front of the robot's gripper, the robot should align the plate to the target location.
- When the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
