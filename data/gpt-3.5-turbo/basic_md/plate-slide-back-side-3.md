To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the plate is not aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, the robot should grab the plate from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate back towards the target location sideways. 
- When the plate is aligned with the target location, the robot should stop sliding the plate and release it.
