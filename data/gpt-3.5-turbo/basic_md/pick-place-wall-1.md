To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot is blocked by the wall and cannot directly reach the goal, the robot should move to the side of the wall that is nearest to the goal to bypass the wall.
- When the robot reaches the other side of the wall and is ready to place the puck, the robot should move the gripper to the goal location and open the gripper to release the puck at the goal.
