To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is below the drawer handle, the robot should move the gripper to the right of the drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer close.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer harder to fully close it.
