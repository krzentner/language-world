To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place the gripper around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should align the peg with the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is horizontally aligned with the hole, the robot should pull the peg out from the side.
