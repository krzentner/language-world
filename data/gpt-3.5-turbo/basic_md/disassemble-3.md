To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put the gripper above the wrench.
- When the gripper is above wrench and the wrench is not left of the robot's gripper and not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not horizontally aligned with the peg or hole, the robot should move wrench to align it with peg/hole.
- When the wrench is aligned with peg/hole, the robot should pull the wrench away from peg.
