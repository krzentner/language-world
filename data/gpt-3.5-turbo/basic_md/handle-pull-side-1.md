To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around handle and handle is not aligned with the robot's gripper horizontally, the robot should align gripper to handle horizontally.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with handle horizontally and handle is not aligned with the robot's gripper vertically, the robot should align gripper to handle vertically.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with handle vertically and handle is not being gripped by the gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the gripper is holding onto the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle until it is fully extended.
