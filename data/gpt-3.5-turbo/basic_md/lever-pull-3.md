To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should put gripper above the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should grab the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is holding the lever, the robot should rotate the gripper upwards to move the lever up.
