To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the box lid, the robot should reach to the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should move the gripper to be above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the gripper is open, the robot should place the box lid onto the box.
