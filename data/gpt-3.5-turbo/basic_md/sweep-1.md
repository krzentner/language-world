To grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move laterally towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
