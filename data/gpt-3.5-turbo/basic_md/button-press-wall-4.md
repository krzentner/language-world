To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the button and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button horizontally, the robot should position the gripper in front of and aligned with the button horizontally.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of and horizontally aligned with the button, the robot should move the gripper closer to the button until it is near the button.
- When the robot's gripper is near the button, the robot should move the gripper up and over the short wall to be above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button, the robot should push down on the button to activate it.
