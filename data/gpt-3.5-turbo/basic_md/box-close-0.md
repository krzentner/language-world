To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place the gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is near the lid and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the lid off the box.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the lid and the robot's gripper is above the box, the robot should move gripper over the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place the lid on top of the box.
- When the lid is on top of the box, the robot's gripper can release the lid.
