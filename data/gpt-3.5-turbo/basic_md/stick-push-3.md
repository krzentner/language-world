To use the stick to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's end of the stick is not near the thermos and not near the target location, the robot should position the stick near the thermos.
- When the robot's end of the stick is near the thermos, the robot should move the end of the stick closer to the thermos until it touches the thermos.
- When the end of the stick touches the thermos, the robot should move the end of the stick in the direction of the target location until the thermos reaches the target location.
