To grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, the robot should put gripper above stick.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is not around the stick, the robot should put gripper around stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the thermos is not in front of the robot, the robot should move gripper and stick towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper and stick are near the thermos and the gripper is not open, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the stick and the thermos is between the robot and the stick, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the thermos is in front of the robot, the robot should use the stick to push the thermos towards the target location.
- When the thermos is at the target location, the robot should release the stick.
