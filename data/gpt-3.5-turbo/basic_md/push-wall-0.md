To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck towards the wall.
- When the wall is almost touching the puck, the robot should push the wall with the gripper to clear the way for the puck.
- When the way is clear, the robot should continue pushing the puck towards the goal.
