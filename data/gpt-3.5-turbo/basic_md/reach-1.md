To reach to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move its gripper to be above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should lower its gripper to reach the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the target object, the robot should carefully move the object to the desired location.
