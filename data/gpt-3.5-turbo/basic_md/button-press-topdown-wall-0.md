To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not behind the wall, the robot should put gripper above button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button but the robot's gripper is behind the wall, the robot should move gripper around the wall to reach the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not around the button, the robot should put gripper around the button.
- When the robot's gripper is around the button, the robot should push down on the button.
