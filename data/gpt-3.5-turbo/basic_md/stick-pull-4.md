To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick handle, the robot should move the gripper closer to the stick handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick handle and not around the stick, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot has a firm grip on the stick, the robot should move the end of the stick to the thermos handle.
- When the end of the stick is near the thermos handle and the robot's gripper is not around the thermos handle, the robot should use the stick to hook onto the thermos handle.
- When the robot has a firm grip on the thermos handle with the stick, the robot should pull the thermos towards the target location while keeping the stick in position. 
- When the thermos is at the target location, the robot should release the thermos handle and put down the stick.
