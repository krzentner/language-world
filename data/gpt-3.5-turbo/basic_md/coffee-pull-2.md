To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug's handle, the robot should put gripper above the mug's handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug's handle and the robot's gripper is not around the mug's handle, the robot should grab the mug's handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug and the mug is not in front of the robot, the robot should move the gripper and mug towards the target location while keeping the grip on the mug handle.
- When the mug is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the table, the robot should release the grip on the mug handle and let the mug slide onto the table.
