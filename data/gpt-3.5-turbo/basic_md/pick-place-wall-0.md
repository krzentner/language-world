To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- At the starting position, the robot should move towards the wall until it is close but not touching.
- When the robot is close to the wall and facing towards the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower gripper to the puck level and move gripper to the side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is beside the puck, the robot should move gripper around the wall and towards the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- When the gripper is holding the puck and facing towards the target location, the robot should lift the puck with gripper and move gripper over the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and facing downwards towards the platform, the robot should lower the puck over the target location and release it from the gripper.
