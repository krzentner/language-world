To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near dial, position the gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial, close the gripper around the dial.
    - When the gripper is closed around the dial, turn the dial to the desired position.
    - When the dial is in the desired position, release the gripper to let go of the dial.
