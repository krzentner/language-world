To perform the task `box-close`, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should place the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the box lid, the robot should move the lid towards the box.
- When the robot's gripper is near the box, the robot should release the grip and place the lid on top of the box. 
- When the lid is successfully placed on the box, the robot should move its gripper away from the box. 

It's important for the robot to ensure that the box lid is picked up and placed on the box properly without dropping it, and that it is able to move away from the box without knocking it over.
