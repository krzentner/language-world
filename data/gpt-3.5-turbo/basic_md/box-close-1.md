- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid and the gripper is not vertically aligned with it, the robot should move gripper above box lid.
- When the gripper is vertically aligned with the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the box lid.
- When the gripper is holding the box lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, the robot should move the gripper above the box.
- When the gripper is above the box and the box lid is not aligned with the box, the robot should align the lid with the box.
- When the box lid is aligned with the box, the robot should place the lid on the box and release the grip.
