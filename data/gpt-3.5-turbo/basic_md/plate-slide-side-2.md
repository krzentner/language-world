To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the plate is not on the side of the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper beside the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate sideways towards the target location.
- When the plate is in the target location, the robot should release the plate and move the gripper away from the plate.
