We cannot determine the exact steps required for the task `door-close` without additional information about the setup. However, in general, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should move the gripper to the door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the door handle and the door is not closed, the robot should push the door closed towards the target location.
