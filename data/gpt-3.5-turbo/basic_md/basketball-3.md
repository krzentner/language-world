To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should place the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the ball, the robot should move towards the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is near the hoop and the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, the robot should move the gripper above the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the robot's gripper and the ball are aligned with the hoop, the robot should release the ball by opening the gripper.
