To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the ball is not in the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the ball is in the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, the robot should move the gripper above the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the ball is in the robot's gripper, the robot should throw the ball into the hoop with enough force to ensure that it goes into the hoop.
