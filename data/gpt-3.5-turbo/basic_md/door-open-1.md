To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should put gripper above the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle and the robot's gripper is not around the door handle, the robot should put the gripper around the door handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the door handle, the robot should pull the door towards itself.
