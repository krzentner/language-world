To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the coffee machine and the button, the robot should move gripper to the coffee machine and position it above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the button is not pressed, the robot should push down on the button to start the coffee machine.
- When the coffee is ready, the robot should release the button by lifting its gripper from the button.
