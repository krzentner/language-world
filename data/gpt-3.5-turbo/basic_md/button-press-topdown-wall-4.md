To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not above the wall, the robot should put gripper above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not above the button, the robot should move gripper forward until it is above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not pushing against the wall, the robot should move gripper down onto the button.
- When the robot's gripper is pushing against the wall, the robot should use a small amount of force to move the gripper and button together until the button is fully pressed.
