To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- If the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should move towards the wall.
- If the robot's gripper is near the wall, but the wall is blocking the path to the target, the robot should move around the wall to reach the target location.
- Once the robot has a clear path to the target, it should perform the steps as mentioned in the `reach` task, which includes reaching towards the goal.
