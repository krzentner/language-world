To slide the puck to the target location reliably in the `push` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the puck and not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should move gripper to above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and not around the puck, the robot should grab the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and not vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move gripper to above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and open, the robot should release the puck. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and closed, the robot should push the puck toward the target location until the puck reaches the target location.
