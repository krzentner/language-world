To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the plate, the robot should move the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not between the gripper fingers, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
- When the plate is held securely by the gripper, the robot should slide the plate toward the target location.
- When the plate is near the target location, the robot should release the gripper to let go of the plate and leave it at the desired location.
