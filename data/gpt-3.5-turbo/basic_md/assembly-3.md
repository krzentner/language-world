To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not almost horizontally aligned with the peg, the robot should align wrench with the peg.
- When the wrench is almost horizontally aligned with the peg, the robot should grab the wrench.
- When the wrench is gripped and the robot's gripper is not almost horizontally aligned with the peg, the robot should align the wrench with the peg.
- When the wrench is vertically and horizontally aligned with the peg, the robot should release the wrench around the peg.
