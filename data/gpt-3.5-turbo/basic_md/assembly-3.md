To grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should put the gripper above the wrench.
- When the gripper is not around the wrench and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not near the peg, the robot should move the wrench to the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg and the wrench is not around the peg, the robot should wrap the wrench around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the wrench is still open, the robot should close the gripper around the wrench and the peg.
