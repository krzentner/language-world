To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put gripper above button.
   - When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move the gripper as close to the button as possible without hitting the wall.
   - When the robot's gripper is close to the button, the robot should push the button forward towards the wall.
   - When the robot's gripper touches the wall, the robot should push down on the button.
