To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot is not near the goal, the robot should push the puck towards the goal.
- When the robot is near the goal, the robot should release the puck by opening the gripper.
