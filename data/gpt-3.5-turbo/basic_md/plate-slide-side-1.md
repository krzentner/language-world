To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move its gripper to the side of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should align the plate with the target location.
- When the plate is aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, the robot should grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not yet at the target location, the robot should slide the plate sideways until it reaches the target location.
- When the plate is at the target location, the robot should release the plate from its gripper.
