To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug, the robot should put the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug, the robot should grab the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug, the robot should lift the mug.
- When the mug is not at the target location, the robot should move the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the mug.
