To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should put gripper above the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever, the robot should pull the gripper towards itself to rotate the lever upwards.
