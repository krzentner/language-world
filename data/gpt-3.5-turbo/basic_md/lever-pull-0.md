To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever handle, the robot should put gripper above lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the lever handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should put gripper around lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, the robot should pull the lever handle up.
