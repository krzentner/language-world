To pull the door open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle, the robot should put gripper above door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle, the robot should put gripper around door handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around door handle, the robot should pull away from door. If the door doesn't open, the robot should move left or right to apply additional force until the door opens.
