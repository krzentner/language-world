To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards towards the goal. 
- When the puck reaches the target location, the robot should release the puck from the gripper.

Note that the direction in which the robot should move the puck backwards may depend on the specific scenario and orientation of the puck relative to the goal.
