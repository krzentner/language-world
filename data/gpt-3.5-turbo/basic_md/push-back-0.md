To slide the puck backwards to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the back of the puck, the robot should align gripper with the back of the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the back of the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is above the goal, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal.
