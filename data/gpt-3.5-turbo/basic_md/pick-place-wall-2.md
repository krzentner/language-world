To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- With the puck in its gripper, the robot should move its gripper above the wall.
- Once the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should move its gripper over to the target location while keeping the puck in its gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location while taking care not to let the gripper hit the wall.
