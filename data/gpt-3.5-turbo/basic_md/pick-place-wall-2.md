To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck.
- The robot should then move sideways to the target location while avoiding the short wall.
- When the robot reaches the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and place the puck at the goal.
