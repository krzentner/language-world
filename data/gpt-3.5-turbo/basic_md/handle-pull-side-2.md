To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    - When handle is not left of the robot's gripper and handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the handle and the handle is not lifted, the robot should pull up on the handle.
