To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move gripper to the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the dial is not in the correct position, the robot should rotate the dial to the correct position.
- When the dial is in the correct position, the robot should stop rotating the dial.
