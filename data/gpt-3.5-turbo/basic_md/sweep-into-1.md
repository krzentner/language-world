To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not around the cube, the robot should move the gripper towards the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pick up the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the cube is not near the target location, the robot should move its gripper and the cube towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the target location and the robot is holding the cube, the robot should release the cube at the target location.
