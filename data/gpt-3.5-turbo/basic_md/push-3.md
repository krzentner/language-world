To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should move towards the target location while keeping the gripper in contact with the puck.
- When the robot approaches the target location and the robot's gripper is in front of the puck, the robot should push the puck towards the goal.
- When the puck reaches the goal, the robot should stop pushing and release the puck by opening the gripper.
