To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper close to the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not in contact with the plate, the robot should put gripper on the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should slide the plate to the target location. 
    - When the plate is in the target location, the robot should release the plate by opening the gripper.
