To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned vertically with the peg, the robot should align the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the gripper is vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should move the gripper towards the wrench.
    - When the gripper is around the wrench, the robot should close the gripper around the wrench.
    - When the gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench away from the peg.
    - When the gripper is not holding the peg, the robot should release the gripper.
