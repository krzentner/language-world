To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should move the gripper above the wrench.
- When the gripper is above the wrench, the robot should close the gripper around the wrench.
- When the gripper is closed around the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench off the peg.
