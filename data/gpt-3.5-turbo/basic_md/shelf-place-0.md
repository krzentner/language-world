To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should move gripper above block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the block and the block is not inside the gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot has gripped the block and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target location, the robot should move to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should open the gripper to place the block at the target location.
