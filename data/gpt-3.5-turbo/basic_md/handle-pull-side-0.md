To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the handle is not left of the robot's gripper and the handle is not below the robot's gripper, the robot should move gripper to left of handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should hold the handle with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the handle is not pulled up, the robot should pull up on the handle.
