To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube, the robot should close the gripper to grab the cube.
- When the cube is in the gripper, the robot should lift the cube up.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, the robot should move the gripper above the bin.
- When the gripper is above the bin, the robot should open the gripper to drop the cube into the bin.
- When the cube is inside the bin, the robot should move the gripper away from the bin.
