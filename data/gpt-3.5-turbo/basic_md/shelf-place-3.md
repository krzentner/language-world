To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is near block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block, the robot should lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location and the block is not too far left or right of the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the block onto the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is open and the block is on the target location, the task is complete.
