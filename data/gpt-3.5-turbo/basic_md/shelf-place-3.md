To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should move gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the block, the robot should drop the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block, the robot should close the gripper to pick up the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block and not above the target location, the robot should move gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and holding the block, the robot should release the block by opening the gripper to place it at the target location.
