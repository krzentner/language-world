To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is not near the cube, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the cube is not inside the goal area, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the cube is not inside the goal area, the robot should move the cube into the goal area.
- When the cube is inside the goal area, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
