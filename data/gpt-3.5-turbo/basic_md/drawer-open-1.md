To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should grab drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle and the drawer is closed, the robot should pull the drawer outwards.
- When the drawer is open, the robot should release the handle and hold the drawer in place.
