To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck, the robot should put gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the puck, the robot should lift the puck up.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location and the puck is above it, the robot should lower the gripper so that the puck is placed at the target location.
