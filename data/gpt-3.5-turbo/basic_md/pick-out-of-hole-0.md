To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg and the peg is still inserted in the hole, the robot should put the gripper above the hole and slowly approach the peg from the side.
- When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the peg is still inserted in the hole, the robot should grip the peg and lift it slightly out of the hole.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the peg and clear of the hole, the robot should align the gripper to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the target location, the robot should place the peg at the goal.
