To grab the peg and pull it out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is already inserted in the hole, the robot should pull the peg away from the hole.
- When the peg is out of the hole and the robot's gripper is still holding the peg, the robot should move the gripper away from the hole.
