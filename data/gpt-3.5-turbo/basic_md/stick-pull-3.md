To grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should move gripper towards the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is near the stick and the robot's gripper is not open, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the stick, the robot should position the stick so that it can be used to reach the thermos handle.
- When the stick is positioned, the robot should grab the thermos handle with the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the thermos handle, the robot should reposition itself so that it can pull the thermos towards the goal.
- When the robot is repositioned, the robot should use the stick to pull the thermos towards the goal.
- When the thermos is at the goal, the robot should release the thermos handle and the stick.
