To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick, the robot should move to the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick towards the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the thermos handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should place the stick under the thermos handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the thermos handle, the robot should lift the thermos handle with the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the thermos is in front of the robot, the robot should move the thermos towards the target location with the help of the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the stick to drop the thermos at the target location.
