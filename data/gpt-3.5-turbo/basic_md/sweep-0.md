To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should move sideways towards the target location while keeping the cube gripped.
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is around the cube, the robot should place the cube at the target location.
