To execute the `sweep` task, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the gripper is not above the cube and the cube is not vertically aligned with the gripper, the robot should position the gripper above the cube.
- When the gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the gripper is closed around the cube and the cube is relatively far from the target location, the robot should move sideways while holding the cube until the robot is near the target location.
- When the gripper is near the target location and the cube is still held securely, the robot should release the cube at the target location.
