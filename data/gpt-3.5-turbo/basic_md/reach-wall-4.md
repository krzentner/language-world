To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near reach target and the short wall is not blocking the robot's path, the robot should reach to goal.
- When the robot encounters the short wall, the robot should move its gripper to the top of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is on top of the wall, the robot should move its gripper to the other side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall, the robot should move its gripper down to the reach target location.
