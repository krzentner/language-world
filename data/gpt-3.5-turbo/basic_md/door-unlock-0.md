To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the dial handle, the robot should move gripper to the dial handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the dial handle and the robot's gripper is not around the dial handle, the robot should put gripper around dial handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial handle, the robot should turn the dial clockwise until the door unlocks.
