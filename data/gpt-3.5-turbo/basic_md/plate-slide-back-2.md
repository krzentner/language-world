To slide the plate back to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the plate back to the target location.
