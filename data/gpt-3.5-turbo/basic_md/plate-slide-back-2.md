To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper to the left of the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and above it, the robot should push the plate back.
- When the plate is close to the target location and the robot's gripper is still holding the plate, the robot should release the plate and move the gripper away.
