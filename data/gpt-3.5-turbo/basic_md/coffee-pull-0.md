To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle, the robot should put gripper above the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle, the robot should put gripper around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the mug handle and the mug is not at the target location, the robot should pull the mug towards the target location.
- When the mug has reached the target location, the robot should release the grip on the mug and move the gripper away from the mug.
