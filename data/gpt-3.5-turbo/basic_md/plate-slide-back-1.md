To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is near plate and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should move the plate back to the target location and slide it into place.
