To grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should place gripper above wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is not close to the peg, the robot should move gripper to the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg, the robot should close the gripper around the peg.
- When the gripper is around the peg, the robot should use the wrench to wrap it around the peg and tighten it if necessary.
