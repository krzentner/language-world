To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench and the wrench is not near the peg, the robot should move the gripper above the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is not near the peg, the robot should move the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should maneuver the wrench to align it with the peg.
- When the wrench is aligned with the peg, the robot should close the gripper around the wrench to hold it in place around the peg.
