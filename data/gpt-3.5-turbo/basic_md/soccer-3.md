To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the ball, the robot should put the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the ball and the robot's gripper is not near the ball, the robot should push the gripper into the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is near the ball and the ball is below the robot's gripper, the robot should push the ball towards the target location using its gripper until it reaches the target.
