To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should lift the puck off the surface.
- When the robot is above the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the puck onto the surface at the target location.
