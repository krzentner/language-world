To grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the wrench, the robot should place the gripper above the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the wrench is not close to the peg, the robot should move the gripper towards the peg.
- When the robot's gripper and the wrench are around the peg, the robot should rotate the wrench around the peg until the assembly is complete.
