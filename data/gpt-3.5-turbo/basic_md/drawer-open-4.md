To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should grab drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle and the drawer is not fully open, the robot should pull the drawer open because if the drawer is fully open, it will not move.
