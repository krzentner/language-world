# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Pull the peg out to the side
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the peg")
    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    if check("the gripper is not left of the peg and the peg is not forward aligned with the gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the peg", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the peg, and the peg is not below the gripper, move the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed and the gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # Now that the gripper is positioned and holding onto the peg, we can pull the peg out to the side.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the wall")
