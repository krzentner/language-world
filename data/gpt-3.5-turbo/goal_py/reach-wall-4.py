# Steps:
    #  1. Move arm to position above the wall
    #  2. Move gripper forward to reach target height, sliding along the wall
    #  3. Move gripper horizontally to reach target location
    # First, move the arm to a position above the wall
    if check("the robot's arm is not above the wall"):
        robot.move_arm("above the wall")
    # Next, move the gripper forward to the height of the target, sliding along the wall
    if check("the robot's gripper is not at the target height and not obstructed by the wall"):
        robot.move_gripper("at the target height, sliding along the wall")
    # Finally, move the gripper horizontally to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not at the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("at the target location")
