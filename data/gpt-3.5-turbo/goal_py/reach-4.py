Great! Now that we have defined functions for different tasks, we can start using them together in a program.

Let's start with a simple program to pick up the puck, move it to the target location, and then slide it to the side. Here's how the program would look like:

```
def pick_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck to goal

def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target

def push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Push gripper into top of puck
    #  3. Slide puck to goal

# Main program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    robot = Robot()
    pick_place(robot)
    reach(robot)
    push(robot)
```

In the `main` function, we create a new `Robot` object and call the `pick_place`, `reach`, and `push` functions one after the other.

You can see that writing a program in this way makes it easier to read and understand the steps involved in each task. It also allows us to reuse these functions in other programs.

Do you have any ideas for other programs we could write using these functions?
