# Steps:
    #  1. Position gripper to one side of the cube
    #  2. Grab the cube with the gripper
    #  3. Move the gripper sideways towards the target location
    #  4. Release the cube at the target location
    
    # First we need to position the gripper to one side of the cube
    if check("the robot's gripper is not to one side of the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("to one side of the cube")
        
    # Once the gripper is in position, we can grab the cube by closing the gripper
    if check("the cube is not in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the cube", close_gripper=True)
    
    # Now we move the gripper towards the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    
    # Finally, we release the cube at the target location by opening the gripper
    if check("the cube is still in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("open gripper")
