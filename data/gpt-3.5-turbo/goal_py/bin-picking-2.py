# Steps:
#  1. Scan bin for cube and determine location
#  2. Move gripper above cube
#  3. Grab cube with gripper
#  4. Move gripper to target bin
#  5. Release cube into target bin

# First, let's scan the bin to find the cube's location
# Assuming we have a scanner module for the robot, we can use it to scan the bin
def scan_bin(robot, bin):
    cube_location = bin.scan_for_cube()
    # Return the location of the cube in the bin
    return cube_location

# Now let's define the bin_picking function
def bin_picking(robot, bin, target_bin):
    # Scan the bin to determine the location of the cube
    cube_location = scan_bin(robot, bin)
    # Move the gripper above the cube
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the cube")
    # Grab the cube with the gripper
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the cube", close_gripper=True)
    # Move the gripper to the target bin
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the cube and is not above the target bin"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target bin")
    # Release the cube into the target bin
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target bin and is holding the cube"):
        robot.move_gripper("into the target bin", open_gripper=True)
