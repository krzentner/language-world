Here's an implementation of the `faucet_open` function:

```
# faucet-open: turn the faucet left
def faucet_open(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper around the faucet handle
    #  2. Turn handle left
    # First, put the gripper roughly around the faucet handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the faucet handle")
    # Once the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can turn the handle left.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the faucet handle")
```

This code checks if the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and if not, it moves the gripper near the handle. Once the gripper is around the handle, it moves the gripper left to turn the handle and open the faucet.
