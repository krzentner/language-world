Here's the code to perform the `button-press-wall` task:

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move the gripper near the button
    #  2. Move the gripper above the button
    #  3. Move the gripper to the left of the button
    #  4. Move the gripper forward to push the button
    # In this scenario, there's a wall we have to work around to reach the button.
    # First, move the gripper near the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the button")
    # Next, move the gripper above the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Now, move the gripper to the left of the button to avoid the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not left of the button and the gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the button")
    # Finally, move the gripper forward to push the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("forward aligned with the button")
```

This code first moves the gripper near the button, then above the button, and then to the left of the button to avoid the wall. Finally, it moves the gripper forward to push the button.
