Here's the complete code to perform the `assembly` task:

```
# assembly: grab the wrench and wrap it around the peg
def assembly(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wrench
    #  2. Close gripper around the wrench
    #  3. Put gripper above the peg
    #  4. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  5. Put the wrench around the peg
    # First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the wrench")
    # If the wrench is not yet grabbed, grab it with the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the wrench", close_gripper=True)
    # Put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the peg")
    # If the gripper is above the peg, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is not around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg")
    # If the gripper is around the peg, wrap the wrench around the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the peg and the wrench is not wrapped around the peg"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the peg", release_gripper=True)
```

This program will put the robot's gripper above the wrench, close the gripper around it, put the gripper above the peg, grab the peg, and finally, wrap the wrench around the peg. Note that this code assumes that the peg is already inserted in a hole and the robot just needs to wrap the wrench around it.
