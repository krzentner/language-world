Here's the solution to the problem:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move gripper up over the wall
    #  5. Move gripper to the target location
    #  6. Move gripper down to the height of the target location
    #  7. Release the puck
    # First, put the gripper roughly above puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the puck and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        # Move the gripper up over the wall
        if check("the robot's gripper is not above the height of the wall"):
            robot.move_gripper("above the height of the wall")
        # Move the gripper to the target location
        if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target location"):
            robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the target location")
        # Move the gripper down to the height of the target location
        if check("the robot's gripper is not at the height of the target location"):
            robot.move_gripper("at the height of the target location")
        # Release the puck
        if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location"):
            robot.release_gripper()
``` 

This program has seven steps to complete the task:
1. Put the gripper above the puck.
2. Drop the gripper around the puck and close it.
3. Move the gripper up over the wall.
4. Move the gripper to the target location.
5. Move the gripper down to the height of the target location.
6. Release the puck.
