Here is the code to perform the `button-press-wall` task:

```
# button-press-wall: push the button from the front with a short wall in the way
def button_press_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Position gripper in front of button
    #  2. Move the robot's arm over the short wall
    #  3. Move the gripper down onto the button
    #  4. Push the button
    # If the gripper is not in front of the button, position it there.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not in front of the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("in front of the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Move the robot's arm over the short wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the wall"):
        robot.move_arm("over the wall")
    # Move the gripper down onto the button.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not on the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("on the button", close_gripper=True)
    # Push the button by moving the gripper forward.
    if check("the robot's gripper is on the button"):
        robot.move_gripper("push the button")
```
