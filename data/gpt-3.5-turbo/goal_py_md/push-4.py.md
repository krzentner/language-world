Here's the completed `push` function:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Drop gripper around puck
    #  3. Close gripper around puck
    #  4. Move puck towards target
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while
    # trying to grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the puck")
    # If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is around the puck, move the puck towards the target.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around puck and the puck is not near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
``` 

This function first lines up the robot's gripper above the puck. It then closes the gripper around the puck and moves the puck towards the target location.
