def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Line up gripper beside the plate
    #  2. Move gripper backwards, dragging plate along
    #  3. Slide gripper and plate sideways into the target location
    # First, put the robot's gripper beside the plate.
    # We want to make sure the gripper is open so that it doesn't bump the plate
    # accidentally.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not beside the plate and the robot's gripper is not open"):
        robot.move_gripper("beside the plate", close_gripper=False)
    # Once the gripper is beside the plate, move it backwards to start sliding
    # the plate.
    # We should keep the gripper open so that it doesn't accidentally let go of
    # the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is beside the plate and the robot's gripper is not behind the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("behind the plate", close_gripper=False)
    # Now that the gripper and plate are behind the target location, slide them
    # sideways into it.
    if check("the robot's gripper and plate are behind the target location and the robot's gripper is not beside the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("beside the target location", close_gripper=False)
```

This code should help the robot slide the plate back sideways into the target location.
