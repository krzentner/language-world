Here's the program to perform the `box-close` task:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
def box_close(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the box lid
    #  2. Close gripper around the box lid
    #  3. Pick up the box lid
    #  4. Move the box lid to the box
    #  5. Line up the box lid with the box
    #  6. Place the box lid on the box
    # First, put the gripper above the box lid.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the box lid")
    # Grab the box lid by closing the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the box lid", close_gripper=True)
    # Pick up the box lid by moving the gripper up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the box lid and the robot's gripper is not near the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the box")
    # Line up the box lid with the box by moving the gripper horizontally
    # above the box.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the box and the box lid is not horizontally aligned with the box"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the box")
    # Place the box lid on the box by opening the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the box and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the box lid", close_gripper=False)
``` 

This program should allow the robot to pick up the box lid and place it on top of the box.
