Here's the completed program:

```
# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
def pick_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above puck
    #  2. Grab puck with gripper
    #  3. Lift puck off the surface
    #  4. Move gripper to target location
    #  5. Put puck down at target location
    # First, put the gripper above the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the puck")
    # Once the gripper is above the puck, we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not around the puck"):
       robot.move_gripper("around the puck", close_gripper=True)
    # Now that the gripper is around the puck, we can lift it up.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is not above the surface"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the surface")
    # With the puck held in the gripper, we can move it to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the surface and the robot's gripper is not near the target location"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
    # Once the gripper is near the target location, we can put the puck down.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is around the puck"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location", close_gripper=False)
```

This program first aligns the robot's gripper with the puck, grabs the puck, lifts it off the surface, moves the gripper over to the target location, and finally places the puck back down.
