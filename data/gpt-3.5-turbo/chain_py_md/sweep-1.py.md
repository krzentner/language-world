# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location

    #  4. Move cube sideways to goal
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the cube so we don't collide with it
    # while trying to grab it.

    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.

        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Try to move the cube sideways to the goal.
    # If we didn't grab it, we'll just go back to an earlier step.
