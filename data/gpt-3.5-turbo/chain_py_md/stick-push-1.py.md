# stick-push: use the stick to push the thermos to the target location
# def stick_push(robot):
# Steps:
#   1. Put one end of the stick close to the thermos
#   2. Grab the other end of the stick with the gripper
#   3. Slide the stick forward to push the thermos
#   We need to put one end of the stick close to the thermos by positioning the robot.
#   Then we can grab the other end of the stick with the gripper and slide it
#   forward to push the thermos to the target location.
#   We may need to adjust the position of the robot and the stick to make sure the push is effective.
if check("the stick is not near the thermos"):
    robot.move("gripper to the correct starting position")
    robot.move("stick to the thermos")
if check("the robot's gripper is not holding the stick"):
    robot.grab("the stick")
if check("the stick is not sliding the thermos to the target location"):
    robot.move("the stick forward")
    
# Note: this code assumes that the robot has both position and force control of its gripper and that it can adjust the position of the stick. If not, additional steps might be needed such as using the arm to move the stick or to adjust the position of the robot.
