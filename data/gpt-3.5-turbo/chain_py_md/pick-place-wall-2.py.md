Sure, here's the code:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Move gripper to wall
    #  2. Move gripper over the wall
    #  3. Move gripper to puck
    #  4. Grab the puck
    #  5. Move gripper back to wall
    #  6. Move gripper over the wall again
    #  7. Move gripper to goal
    #  8. Move gripper down to place the puck
    #  9. Open the gripper to release the puck
    # First, move the gripper to the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to wall")
    # Once the gripper is near the wall, move it over the wall to grab the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall but not over the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper over the wall")
    # Once the gripper is over the wall, move it to the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is over the wall but not near the puck"):
        robot.move("gripper to puck")
    # Once the gripper is near the puck, grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("puck")
    # Once the puck is grabbed, move the gripper back to the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and not near the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to wall")
    # Once the gripper is near the wall again, move it over the wall.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall but not over the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper over the wall")
    # Once the gripper is over the wall again, move it to the goal.
    if check("the robot's gripper is over the wall but not near the goal"):
        robot.move("gripper to goal")
    # Once the gripper is near the goal, move it down to place the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the goal but not down near the goal"):
        robot.move("gripper down to goal")
    # Once the gripper is down near the goal, open the gripper to release the puck.
    if check("the robot's gripper is down near the goal and the robot's gripper is holding the puck"):
        robot.release("puck")
``` 

This code assumes that the robot knows the location of the wall, the puck, and the goal, and has the ability
