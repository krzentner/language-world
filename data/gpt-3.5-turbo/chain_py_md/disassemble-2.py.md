Here's a program to perform the `disassemble` task:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
def disassemble(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the wrench
    #  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper
    #  3. Move the wrench away from the peg
    # We need to grab the wrench, which is on a peg. First, put the gripper
    # above the wrench.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    # Once the gripper is above the wrench, we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above wrench and the robot's gripper is not holding anything"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    # Now that we have the wrench, we should move it away from the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding wrench"):
        robot.move("wrench away from peg")
```

This program is similar to the others, but it has three steps instead of the usual two. We first put the gripper over the wrench, then grab the wrench, and finally move it away from the peg.
