Here's the completed code for the `sweep` task:

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location
def sweep(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper next to cube
    #  2. Grab cube with gripper
    #  3. Lift cube off surface
    #  4. Move gripper and cube to target location
    #  5. Lower cube down onto surface
    # First, put the gripper next to the cube. Since we need to move the cube
    # sideways, we need to align the gripper with the edge of the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not next to the cube"):
        robot.move("gripper next to cube edge")
    # If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    # If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing
    # the gripper.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    # We closed the gripper, and the cube is still near the gripper, so maybe we
    # grabbed it.
    # Lift the cube off the surface by moving the gripper upwards.
    if check("the robot's gripper is closed around cube"):
        robot.lift("gripper with cube")
    # If the gripper is above the target location, lower the cube onto the surface
    # at the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above target location"):
        robot.drop("gripper with cube at target location")
    # If we need to move the cube to the target location, move the gripper along
    # with the cube sideways.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and target location is not aligned with gripper"):
        robot.move("gripper and cube sideways to target location")
    # Once we're above the target location again, lower the cube onto the surface
    # at the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is above target location"):
        robot.drop("gripper with cube at target location")
```

Note that I added a few custom methods (`lift` and `move`) that were not included in the original code, but their behavior should be self-explanatory based on their names and usage within the `sweep` task.
