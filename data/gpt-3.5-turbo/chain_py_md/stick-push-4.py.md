Here's a program to perform the `stick-push` task:

```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put the gripper above the stick
    #  2. Grab the stick with the gripper
    #  3. Line up the stick with the thermos
    #  4. Push the stick into the thermos
    #  5. Move the stick and thermos to the target location
    # First, put the gripper roughly above the stick.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    # Once we've got the gripper above the stick, we can grab it.
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("the stick")
    # We've got the stick in the gripper, so now we need to line up the stick
    # with the thermos.
    # First, check if the stick is roughly above the thermos.
    if check("the stick is not roughly above the thermos"):
        robot.move("stick to above the thermos")
    # Now that the stick is lined up from above, we need to push it into the
    # thermos.
    # By pushing the stick from the top, it should slide into the thermos
    # horizontally.
    if check("the stick is roughly above the thermos"):
        robot.push("the stick into the thermos")
    # Once the stick is in the thermos, both can be moved together to the goal.
    if check("the stick is in the thermos"):
        robot.move("thermos and stick to the goal")
```

I hope this helps you with your robot controlling needs! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.
