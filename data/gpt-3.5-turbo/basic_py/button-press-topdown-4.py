Oops, it seems like there's a duplicate function written here. Let me suggest a new robot task instead:

# shelf-retrieve: retrieve an item from the shelf and bring it to the designated location
# def shelf_retrieve(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the target item"):
        robot.move("gripper above the shelf where the target item is located")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the shelf where the target item is located"):
        robot.grab("the target item")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the target item"):
        robot.move("the gripper to the designated location")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the designated location"):
        robot.release("the target item at the designated location")
