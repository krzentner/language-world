One possible algorithm for the "reach_wall" task could be:

1. Check if the robot is too far from the reach target and move closer if needed.
2. Check if there is a wall between the robot and the reach target.
3. If there is a wall, check if the robot's arm can reach over it.
4. If the robot can reach over the wall, move the arm to the target location and grab any object if necessary.
5. If the robot cannot reach over the wall, move to a different position where the arm can reach and repeat steps 2-4.

Here's the code:

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot is not near the reach target"):
        robot.move("to goal")
    if check("there is a wall between the robot and the reach target"):
        if check("the robot's arm can reach over the wall"):
            robot.move("arm to goal location")
            if check("there is an object to grab"):
                robot.grab("object at goal")
        else:
            robot.move("to different position")
            reach_wall(robot)
    else:
        robot.reach("to goal location")
