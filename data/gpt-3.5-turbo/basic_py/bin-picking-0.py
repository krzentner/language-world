There are many ways to approach bin picking, as it can be a complex task that involves multiple steps such as identifying the cube, grasping it, and placing it in the correct bin. Here is one possible outline for a bin picking function:

# bin-picking: pick up the cube and place it in the target bin
def bin_picking(robot):
    # Step 1: Move gripper to above bin and open it
    if check("the gripper is not above the target bin"):
        robot.put("gripper above bin")
    if check("the gripper is above the target bin and closed"):
        robot.open("gripper")
        
    # Step 2: Identify and locate the cube
    if check("the robot does not see the cube yet"):
        robot.look("for the cube")
    if check("the cube is not in the gripper's range of motion"):
        robot.move("gripper to cube's location")
        
    # Step 3: Grasp the cube
    if check("the gripper is not around the cube and aligned with it"):
        robot.grab("cube")
        
    # Step 4: Move the gripper to the target bin and release the cube
    if check("the gripper is not above the target bin with the cube"):
        robot.move("gripper to above the target bin with the cube")
    if check("the gripper is above the target bin with the cube and closed"):
        robot.release("cube into bin")
