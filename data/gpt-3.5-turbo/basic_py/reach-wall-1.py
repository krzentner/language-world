Firstly, we need to make sure that the robot's arm is high enough to clear the wall, so we'll lift it up using the "raise" command. 
Then, we'll move the robot's gripper to the right of the wall using the "move" command. 
Next, we'll lower the robot's arm using the "lower" command. 
Finally, we'll move the robot's gripper towards the target location using the "reach" command. 

Here's the updated code for the "reach_wall" function:

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's arm is not raised"):
        robot.raise("arm")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not right of the wall and the robot's arm is raised"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of wall")
    if check("the robot's arm is not lowered and the gripper is right of the wall"):
        robot.lower("arm")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not at the goal location"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
