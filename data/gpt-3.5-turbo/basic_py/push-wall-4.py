First, the robot needs to identify the location of the small wall and the puck. Then, it can execute the following steps:

- Approach the wall and stop when the gripper is near the wall.
- Move the gripper to the side of the wall, closest to the puck.
- Approach the puck and stop when the gripper is near the puck.
- Align the gripper to be above the puck.
- Close the gripper to grab the puck.
- Move the gripper to the side of the wall, closest to the goal.
- Approach the goal and stop when the gripper is near the goal.
- Align the gripper to be above the target location.
- Open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.

The code for this task can be something like this:

# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    puck_pos = find_puck()
    wall_pos = find_wall()
    if check("the robot is not near the wall"):
        robot.move_to(wall_pos)
    if check("the gripper is not next to the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of wall")
    if check("the robot is not near the puck"):
        robot.move_to(puck_pos)
    if check("the gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.put("gripper above the puck")
    if check("the gripper is not closed around the puck"):
        robot.close("gripper around the puck")
    if check("the gripper is not next to the goal"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of goal")
    if check("the robot is not near the goal"):
        robot.move_to(goal_pos)
    if check("the gripper is not above the target location"):
        robot.put("gripper above the target location")
    if check("the gripper is not open"):
        robot.open("gripper")
