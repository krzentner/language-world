Here's an implementation for push_wall:

# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        # Move gripper to the puck
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        # Move puck around the wall
        if check("the wall is on the left side of the robot"):
            robot.turn("left")
            robot.move("forward")
            robot.turn("right")
            robot.push("the puck to the goal")
        elif check("the wall is on the right side of the robot"):
            robot.turn("right")
            robot.move("forward")
            robot.turn("left")
            robot.push("the puck to the goal")
    if check("the puck is at the goal and the robot's gripper is above the goal"):
        robot.place("puck at goal")
