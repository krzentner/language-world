First, we need to check the height of the wall and the position of the puck relative to the wall.

    if check("the wall height is taller than the gripper height and the puck is behind the wall"):
        robot.move("around the wall")
    if check("the wall height is taller than the gripper height and the puck is in front of the wall"):
        robot.drop("gripper above puck")
        robot.move("around the wall")
        robot.grab("puck")
        robot.move("back around the wall")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
    if check("the wall height is shorter than the gripper height and the puck is behind the wall"):
        robot.move("around the wall")
        robot.drop("gripper above puck")
        robot.move("back around the wall")
        robot.grab("puck")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
    if check("the wall height is shorter than the gripper height and the puck is in front of the wall"):
        robot.drop("gripper above puck")
        robot.grab("puck")
        robot.place("puck at goal") 

Note that if the wall height is taller than the gripper height, we need to move around the wall before grabbing the puck. If the wall height is shorter than the gripper height, we need to first drop the gripper above the puck, move around the wall, grab the puck, move back around the wall, and place the puck at the goal.
