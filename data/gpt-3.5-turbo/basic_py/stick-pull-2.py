If the instructions for the stick-pull task are not provided, I can create a possible set of instructions:

# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick and the gripper is not above the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the stick and the gripper is not around the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the stick and the stick is not aligned with the thermos handle"):
        robot.align("stick to thermos handle")
    if check("the stick is aligned with the thermos handle and the thermos is not aligned with the target location"):
        robot.pull("thermos to goal")
    if check("the thermos is at the target location"):
        robot.drop("stick")
