First, we need to make sure that the robot is near the mug handle. 
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the mug handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of the mug handle")
Next, we need to make sure that the robot's gripper is around the mug handle.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the mug handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.release("gripper around the mug handle")
Once the robot's gripper is around the mug handle, we need to pull the mug towards the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the mug handle"):
        robot.pull("mug towards the target location")
