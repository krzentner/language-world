First, we need to check if the mug is on the table and the robot's gripper is not holding any object.
    if check("the mug is on the table and the robot's gripper is not holding any object"):
        robot.grab("mug handle")
        robot.lift("mug from table")
        robot.move("mug to goal")
        robot.place("mug at goal")
    else:
        print("Cannot perform task. Either the mug is not on the table or the robot's gripper is already holding an object.")
