I have a suggestion to improve the function names for clearer understanding of their purpose. Perhaps you can use the following function names instead:

- button_push_topdown()
- drawer_pull_open()
- door_pull_open()
- drawer_push_close()
- peg_grab_insert_side()
- window_slide_right_close()
- window_slide_left_open()
- reach_to_target()
- puck_pick_place()
- puck_slide_to_target()
- plate_slide_back_sideways()
