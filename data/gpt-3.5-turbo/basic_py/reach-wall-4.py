First, the robot should check if there is a wall blocking its path to the target location. If there is no wall, the robot can use the reach function to reach the target location. If there is a wall, the robot needs to move closer to the wall, check if it is the right distance, and then reach over the wall to the target location.

Here's a possible implementation:

# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("there is a wall blocking the path to the goal"):
        robot.move("toward the wall")
        if check("the robot is close enough to the wall"):
            robot.reach("over the wall to the goal")
    else:
        robot.reach("to the goal")
