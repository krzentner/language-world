Here's the completed program to perform the `pick-place-wall` task:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
        
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
        
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        if check("the puck is blocked by a wall"):
            robot.lift("gripper above wall")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
        
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the wall and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.slide("gripper to edge of wall")
        robot.open("gripper")
```

This program first checks that the gripper is above the puck and that it's open. If either of these checks fails, it moves the gripper into position and opens it. 

Once the gripper is in the correct position and open, it closes around the puck. Then, it checks if the puck is blocked by a wall. If it is, the program lifts the gripper above the wall before placing the puck at the goal location.

Finally, if the gripper is above the wall and closed, the program slides it to the edge of the wall and opens the gripper to release the puck.
