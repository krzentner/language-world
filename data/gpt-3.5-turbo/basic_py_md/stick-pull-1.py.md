Here is the completed program to perform the `stick-pull` task:

```
# stick-pull: grab the stick and use it to pull the thermos to the target location
def stick_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the stick and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the thermos handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to thermos handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the thermos handle"):
        robot.pull("thermos to goal")
```

This program first checks if the gripper is not aligned with the stick, and if so, moves the gripper above the stick. The program then checks if the gripper is vertically aligned with the stick, and if so, grabs the stick. Next, the program checks if the gripper is holding the stick and is not aligned with the thermos handle, and if so, moves the gripper to the thermos handle. Finally, the program checks if the gripper is around the thermos handle, and if so, pulls the thermos to the goal location.
