Here's a program to perform the `door-unlock` task using the given code:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
def door_unlock(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door dial"):
        robot.move("gripper to the right of door dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the door dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial"):
        robot.grab("door dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the door dial"):
        robot.turn("dial clockwise")
    if check("the dial shows the correct combination"):
        robot.release("door dial")
        robot.move("gripper away from dial")
```

Note that I added two new commands: `turn`, which rotates the dial clockwise or counterclockwise until it reaches the correct combination; and `release`, which opens the gripper and releases the door dial. Also, the `move` command was used to move the gripper to the right of the door dial before grabbing it.

I hope this helps you control your robot effectively!
