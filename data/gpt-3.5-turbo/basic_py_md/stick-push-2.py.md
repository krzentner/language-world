Here's the code you can add to perform the `stick-push` task:

```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above the stick")
    if check("the stick is not in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the thermos"):
        robot.place("gripper above thermos")
    if check("the stick is above the thermos and the robot's gripper is not vertical with the thermos"):
        robot.align("stick to thermos")
    if check("the stick is almost horizontal with the thermos"):
        robot.push("thermos to the goal")
    if check("the thermos is at the goal and the stick is still in the gripper"):
        robot.drop("stick")
```

Make sure that you update the function calls with the appropriate instructions for your robot's gripper and movement abilities.
