def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.put("gripper above plate")
    if check("the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is sideways aligned with the plate and the plate is not at the target location"):
        robot.slide("the plate back")

``` 

This program will first check if the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate, and if not, it will move the gripper above the plate. Then, it will check if the plate is to the left of the gripper and not already forward-aligned with the gripper, and if so, it will grab the plate. Next, it will check if the gripper is sideways aligned with the plate and the plate is not at the target location yet, and if so, it will slide the plate back. Finally, when the plate is at the target location, the robot will release the plate.
