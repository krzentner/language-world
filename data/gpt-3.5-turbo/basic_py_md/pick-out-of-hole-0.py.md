Here's the program to perform the `pick-out-of-hole` task:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the peg"):
        robot.place("the gripper above the hole")
    if check("the gripper is not around the peg and the gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("the gripper around the peg")
    if check("the gripper is near the peg and the gripper is open"):
        robot.close("the gripper around the peg")
    if check("the gripper is above the peg and the gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the peg out of the hole")
        robot.reach("to goal")
```

This program follows the structure of the previous ones, checking for specific conditions and then calling the appropriate actions. In this case, the robot first moves its gripper above the peg, then closes it around the peg, and finally lifts the peg out of the hole and moves it to the goal location.
