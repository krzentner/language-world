Here is the code to perform the task `plate-slide-back-side`:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate"):
        robot.move("gripper near the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is not aligned with the plate"):
        robot.align("gripper with the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not below the plate"):
        robot.move("gripper below the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is below the plate and the robot's gripper is not tightly gripping the plate"):
        robot.grab("the plate")
    if check("the robot's gripper is tightly gripping the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location"):
        robot.move("plate sideways to target location")
    if check("the plate is aligned with the target location"):
        robot.slide("the plate into the target location")
```
