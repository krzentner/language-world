Here's a program to perform the `stick-push` task using the robot's gripper:

```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the stick is not left of the robot's gripper and the stick is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the stick and the stick is not touching the thermos"):
        robot.push("stick towards thermos")
    if check("the stick is touching the thermos"):
        if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the thermos"):
            robot.put("gripper above thermos")
        if check("the gripper is not around the thermos and the gripper is open"):
            robot.drop("gripper around thermos")
        if check("the gripper is not around the thermos and the gripper is closed"):
            robot.rotate("gripper around thermos")
        if check("the gripper is around the thermos"):
            robot.push("thermos to target location")
```

Note that this program assumes there is a `check` function that takes a string argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the condition is currently true. The `robot` object has methods such as `put`, `grab`, `push`, `drop`, `rotate`, and `slide` that allow it to perform various actions. You may need to modify the program depending on the specifics of your robot and the task you have in mind.
