Here's the program to complete the last task:

```
# window-close: slide the window closed to the right
def window_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window right")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window right harder")
```

This program follows the same structure as the other tasks, with the necessary checks and actions to slide the window closed to the right.
