Here's the program to perform the `window-open` task:

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
def window_open(robot):
    if check("the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.push("window left harder")
```

This code checks if the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the gripper is not near the handle. If true, it moves the gripper to the right of the handle. Then, it slides the window open to the left and pushes it harder if necessary. This should complete the `window-open` task.
