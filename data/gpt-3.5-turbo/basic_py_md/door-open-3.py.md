Here's the completed code to perform the task `door-open`:

```
# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around door handle"):
        robot.pull("away from door")
``` 

This function checks if the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the door handle, and if not, it moves the gripper above the handle. Then, the function checks if the gripper is around the door handle, and if not, it puts the gripper around the handle. Finally, the function pulls the gripper away from the door handle to open the door.
