Here's the code to perform the `sweep` task:

```
# sweep: grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location
def sweep(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the cube"):
        robot.put("gripper above the cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around the cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the cube and the cube is not aligned with the target"):
        robot.move("gripper to the right of the cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is to the right of the cube and the cube is not at the target"):
        robot.slide("the cube to the target")
``` 

This code checks if the gripper is above the cube and if not, moves it above the cube. Then it checks if the gripper is around the cube and if not, drops it around the cube. It closes the gripper around the cube and moves it to the right of the cube. Finally, it slides the cube towards the target location.
