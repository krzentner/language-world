Here's the code for the `stick-push` task:

```
# stick-push: grab the stick and use it to push the thermos to the target location
def stick_push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick"):
        robot.put("gripper above stick")
    if check("the stick is not in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("stick")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the thermos"):
        robot.move("gripper to thermos")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the thermos and the thermos is not pushed all the way to the goal"):
        robot.push("the stick into the thermos and push the thermos to the goal")
    if check("the thermos is at goal"):
        robot.relax("let go of the stick and thermos")
``` 

This code assumes that there is a thermos that needs to be pushed to a target location using a stick that the robot must grab. It first checks if the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the stick, and if so, moves the gripper above it. Then, it checks if the stick is not in the gripper, and if so, grabs it. Next, it checks if the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, and if so, moves it there.

If the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the thermos and the thermos is not pushed all the way to the goal, it pushes the stick into the thermos and pushes them both to the goal. Finally, it checks if the thermos is at the goal location and then relaxes the gripper to let go of the stick and thermos.
