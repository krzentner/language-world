Here's the program to perform the task `door-unlock`:

```
# door-unlock: turn the dial on the door
def door_unlock(robot):
    if check("the dial is not in the correct position"):
        robot.turn("the dial to the left")
    if check("the dial is in the correct position but the door is not unlocked"):
        robot.turn("the dial to the right")
    if check("the door is unlocked"):
        robot.pull("the door handle to open the door")
```

Note that I have assumed that the robot needs to first turn the dial to the left and then to the right to unlock the door. The specific details of how to turn the dial may vary depending on the design of the robot and the door. Please adjust the code as needed.
