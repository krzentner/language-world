# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        if check("the path to the target location is blocked by the wall"):
            robot.move("to the side of the wall")
            robot.move("towards the target location")
            robot.move("back to center")
        robot.place("puck at goal")
``` 

This code first checks if the gripper is above the puck, and proceeds to drop the gripper around it if it is not already around it and the gripper is open. The gripper is then closed, and if the gripper is above the puck and closed, the robot checks if the path to the target location is blocked by the wall. If it is, the robot moves to the side of the wall, moves towards the target location, and then moves back to the center. Finally, the robot places the puck at the goal location.
