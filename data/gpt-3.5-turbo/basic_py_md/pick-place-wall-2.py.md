This program first follows the steps of `pick-place`, to pick up the puck and hold it at the target location. Then it checks for a short wall between the robot's gripper and the goal. If such a wall exists, it instructs the robot to lift its gripper above the wall. Finally, the program places the puck over the goal, regardless of whether there is a wall there or not.
