Here's the program to perform the `disassemble` task:

```
# disassemble: pull the wrench off the peg
def disassemble(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench"):
        robot.put("gripper above wrench")
    if check("the wrench is not in the robot's gripper"):
        robot.grab("wrench")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the wrench is not near the peg"):
        robot.move("gripper above peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the wrench is not vertically aligned with the peg"):
        robot.lower("the wrench to be vertically aligned with the peg")
    if check("the wrench is vertically aligned with the peg but not around it"):
        robot.move("the gripper around the wrench")
    if check("the wrench is around the peg but still being held by the robot's gripper"):
        robot.pull("the wrench off the peg")
```

This program first checks whether the robot's gripper is in the correct position to grip the wrench. It then checks whether the wrench is already in the gripper or not. If not, it instructs the robot to grab the wrench. Next, it checks whether the gripper is in the correct position to pull the wrench off the peg and if necessary, repositions the gripper using the `move` command. Finally, it lowers the wrench and grips it around the peg, and then pulls it off the peg using the `pull` command.
