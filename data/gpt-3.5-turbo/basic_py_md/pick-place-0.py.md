Sure, here's the completed code for the `pick_place` task:

```
# pick-place: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location
def pick_place(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.move("gripper to puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is open"):
        robot.grab("puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the puck and the puck is not at the target location"):
        robot.move("gripper to target location")
    if check("the puck is at the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the puck"):
        robot.hold("puck at target location")
```

This code assumes that the puck is initially located somewhere and needs to be picked up and placed at a target location. The `check` function is used to verify that the robot is in the correct position before each action is taken. 

First, the robot moves its gripper to the puck's location. If the gripper is positioned correctly and open, it grabs the puck. The gripper then moves to the target location and holds the puck in place.
