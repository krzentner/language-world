Sure, here's the program to perform the `push` task:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.move("gripper to puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the puck and the puck is not at goal"):
        robot.slide("puck to goal")
    if check("the puck is at goal"):
        robot.release("gripper")
```

This program first moves the robot gripper to the puck, and after checking it is above the puck, it drops the gripper around the puck. The program checks that the gripper is around the puck and the robot is aligned with the goal. If the condition is satisfied, it performs a slide operation to push the puck to the goal location. Finally, when it detects that the puck has reached the goal, it releases the gripper.
