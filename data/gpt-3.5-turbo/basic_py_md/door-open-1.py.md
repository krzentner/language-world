Here's the code to perform the `door-open` task:

```
# door-open: pull the door open
def door_open(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with door handle and the robot's gripper is not around door handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around door handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around door handle"):
        robot.pull("door towards robot")
```

This code checks if the gripper is positioned correctly and then pulls the door towards the robot. You can use the same code structure to write other tasks for the robot.
