Here's your program:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("gripper to puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is open and has not picked up the puck"):
        robot.grab("puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is almost near the wall and the puck is in the way"):
        robot.slide("gripper to the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the wall and the puck is in the way"):
        robot.push("puck around the wall")
    if check("the puck is past the wall and the robot's gripper is not at the goal"):
        robot.move("gripper to the goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is at the goal"):
        robot.drop("puck at goal")
``` 

This program checks if the gripper is near the puck and closed, and then moves the gripper to the puck if it isn't. Then, if the gripper is open and has not picked up the puck, it tells the robot to grab the puck. Next, the program checks if the gripper is almost near the wall and the puck is in the way. If so, it instructs the robot to slide the gripper all the way to the wall. Once the gripper is near the wall and the puck is in the way, the program tells the robot to push the puck around the wall. Lastly, it checks if the puck is past the wall and the gripper is not at the goal. If this is the case, it moves the gripper to the goal. Finally, the robot drops the puck at the goal.
