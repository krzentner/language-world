Here's the program to perform the `window-open` task:

```
# window-open: slide the window open to the left
def window_open(robot):
    if check("the window handle is left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of window handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the window handle"):
        robot.slide("window left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle"):
        robot.pull("window left harder")
```

This program checks if the window handle is to the left of the robot's gripper and moves the gripper to the right of it if it's not.
Then, it slides the window to the left and pulls it harder if needed.
