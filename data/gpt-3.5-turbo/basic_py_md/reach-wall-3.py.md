Here is the program to perform the `reach-wall` task:

```
# reach-wall: reach to the target location with a short wall in the way
def reach_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not aligned with the wall"):
        robot.move("gripper to the side of the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the wall"):
        robot.lift("gripper above the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the goal"):
        robot.move("gripper to the goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is aligned with the goal and the goal is not below the gripper"):
        robot.lower("gripper to the goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the goal"):
        robot.reach("to goal")
``` 

This program first moves the gripper to the side of the wall, lifts it above the wall, moves it to the goal, lowers it to the goal, and finally reaches to the goal with the gripper.
