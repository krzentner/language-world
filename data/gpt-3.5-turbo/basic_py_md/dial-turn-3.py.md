Certainly! Here's the code to perform the `dial-turn` task:

```
# dial-turn: turn the dial
def dial_turn(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the dial"):
        robot.grab("dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the dial and the dial is not at the desired position"):
        robot.rotate("dial to correct position")
    if check("the dial is at the desired position"):
        robot.release("gripper")
```

This code will make sure the gripper is positioned correctly, rotate the dial to the desired position, and then release the gripper. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you need help with anything else!
