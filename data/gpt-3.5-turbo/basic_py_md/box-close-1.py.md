Here's the modified code to perform the task:

```
# box-close: pick up the box lid and place it on the box
def box_close(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the box lid"):
        robot.place("gripper above box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near box lid and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above box lid and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("box lid")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the box and the box lid is lifted"):
        robot.place("box lid on top of the box")
    if check("the box lid is on top of the box"):
        robot.drop("the box lid")
```


This function starts by picking up the box lid, placing it on top of the box, and then dropping it in place. Note that the function assumes that the robot is already aligned with the box and the box lid before the function is called. The `check()` function is called at each step to verify that the robot's gripper is in the correct position before proceeding with the next step. In addition, the robot uses different methods such as `lift()` and `drop()` to manipulate the box lid during the process.

I hope this helps you control the robot and perform the `box-close` task successfully!
