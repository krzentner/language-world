# button-press-topdown: push the button down from above
def button_press_topdown(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above button and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not near button"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the button")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the button and the button is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.push("the button down") 

Note: The code assumes that there is a function `check()` that returns a boolean indicating whether the specified condition is true or false. This function is not defined in the given code block, so you will need to either define it or modify the code to work without it. Additionally, the `robot` object is assumed to have methods such as `put()`, `push()`, `grab()`, `slide()`, `align()`, `insert()`, `place()`, `drop()`, and `close()`, and it is assumed that the robot's movement and gripper control is accurate enough to complete the task.
