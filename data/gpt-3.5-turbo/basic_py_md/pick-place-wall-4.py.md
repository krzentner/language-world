Here's the program to perform the `pick-place-wall` task:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the puck"):
        robot.reach("to puck")
    if check("the puck is on the other side of the wall and the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is in front of the puck and the wall separates the robot from the puck"):
        robot.lift("the gripper over the wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is on the other side of the wall"):
        robot.put("the gripper next to the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the gripper is around the puck and the gripper is not near the goal"):
        robot.push("gripper to goal")
    if check("the gripper is near the goal"):
        robot.drop("gripper release puck at goal")
```

This program first moves the gripper to the puck and then checks if the puck is on the other side of the wall. If so, the robot slides the puck to the wall, lifts the gripper over the wall to the other side, and puts the gripper next to the puck. The gripper then picks up the puck, moves it to the goal, and releases it.
