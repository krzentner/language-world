Here's a program to perform the `pick-place-wall` task:

```
# pick-place-wall: pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way
# def pick_place_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the puck"):
        robot.place("gripper above puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near puck and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above puck and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.place("puck over wall")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above goal"):
        robot.move("gripper over goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above goal and the robot's gripper is not near goal"):
        robot.move("gripper to goal")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near goal and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.drop("gripper at goal")
```

This program assumes that there is a short wall between the puck and the goal, and that the robot can pick up the puck, lift it over the wall, carry it to the goal, and place it there. The program checks whether the gripper is in the right position to perform each step of the task, and calls the appropriate methods to move the gripper as needed.
