Here's the code to complete the `soccer` function:

```
# soccer: push the soccer ball into the target location
def soccer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above soccer ball"):
        robot.put("gripper above soccer ball")
        
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around soccer ball")

    if check("the robot's gripper is near soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around soccer ball")

    if check("the robot's gripper is above soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.move("gripper to right of soccer ball")
    
    if check("the robot's gripper is right of soccer ball and soccer ball is right of goal post"):
        robot.slide("soccer ball to the right")
    
    if check("the robot's gripper is near right of soccer ball and soccer ball is right of goal post"):
        robot.push("soccer ball into goal")
``` 

This function first checks that the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and then uses the `drop` and `close` methods to pick it up. Once the soccer ball is in the robot's gripper, the function moves the gripper to the right of the ball towards the goalpost using the `move` method. 

Next, the function checks if the robot's gripper is in the correct position to push the soccer ball towards the goal. If the soccer ball is still to the right of the goalpost, the function uses the `slide` method to move it to the right. Finally, when the gripper is aligned with the ball and it's near the goalpost, the function uses the `push` method to push the ball into the goal.
