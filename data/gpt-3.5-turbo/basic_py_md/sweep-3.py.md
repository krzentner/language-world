# sweep: grab the cube and move sideways it to the target location
# def sweep(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above cube"):
        robot.place("gripper above cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near cube and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around cube")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above cube and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        if check("the robot is not close to the sweeping area"):
            robot.move("to the sweeping area")
        if check("the robot is on the left side of the sweeping area"):
            robot.slide("cube to the right")
        if check("the robot is on the right side of the sweeping area"):
            robot.slide("cube to the left")
        if check("the robot is back to the initial position"):
            robot.place("cube at goal")
``` 

Note: This code assumes that the sweeping area is located along the robot's horizontal axis, and that the robot should approach the area from the same side on which it can slide the cube towards the goal. If these assumptions are incorrect, the code may need to be adapted accordingly. Also, the comment `check()` is not defined in the given code, so you may need to either implement it or replace it with a suitable condition that reflects the robot's perception of its surroundings.
