# lever-pull: rotate the lever up
def lever_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever"):
        robot.put("gripper above lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the gripper is not around the lever"):
        robot.grab("lever")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the lever"):
        robot.rotate("lever up")
``` 

This code should work for a basic lever mechanism where the lever needs to be rotated upwards using a single gripper on a robot. If there are additional constraints or requirements, please let me know and I'd be happy to make adjustments or add more functionality.
