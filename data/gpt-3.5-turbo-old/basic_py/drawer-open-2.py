Sorry, there seems to be a duplicate function of `drawer_open`. Here are the functions for `close_drawer` and `open_drawer` instead:

# close-drawer: push the drawer close
# def close_drawer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle"):
        robot.grab("drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is forward aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.push("drawer closed")

# open-drawer: pull the drawer open
# def open_drawer(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper above drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around drawer handle"):
        robot.put("gripper around drawer handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is around drawer handle"):
        robot.pull("away from drawer")
