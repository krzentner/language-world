I see that the previous code was incomplete. Here is a completed version for the `reach` function:

```
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the reach target")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near reach target and closed"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the reach target")
``` 

This function assumes that the robot's gripper is already closed before reaching the target. If it's not closed, you may need to add a step to close it before moving to the target location.
