Since we already have a `pick_place` function defined above for picking up and holding a puck, we can reuse that code for picking up an object and placing it at a target location. We just need to update the comments to reflect the general nature of the function.

# pick-place: pick up an object and hold it at the target location
# def pick_place(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the object
    #  2. Grab the object with the gripper
    #  3. Move the gripper to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the object.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above the object"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the object")
    # If the gripper isn't around the object, put it around the object.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the object and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the object", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is near the object and closed, move it to the target
    # location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the object and the object is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the target location")
