# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle
    #  2. Push the door closed
    # If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle.
    # We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large
    # and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the door handle")
    # If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from behind, we can push
    # the door closed to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is behind aligned with the door handle"):
        robot.move_gripper("around the door handle")
