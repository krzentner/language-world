# Steps:
    #  1. Check if there is a wall between the robot's gripper and the puck
    #  2. If there is, move the gripper to either side of the wall
    #  3. Move the gripper above the puck and pick it up
    #  4. Move the gripper to the target location above the wall
    #  5. Lower the puck to the target location
    
    # Check if there is a wall between the robot's gripper and the puck.
    # If so, move the gripper to either side of the wall.
