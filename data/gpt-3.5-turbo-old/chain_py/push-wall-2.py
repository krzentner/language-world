# Steps:
    #  1. Determine which side of the wall the puck is on
    #  2. Position the gripper on the same side as the puck, but on the other side of the wall
    #  3. Slide the gripper over the wall
    #  4. Move the gripper down to the puck
    #  5. Push the puck to the target location
    # First, determine which side of the wall the puck is on
