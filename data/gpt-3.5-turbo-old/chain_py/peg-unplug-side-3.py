# Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the peg
    #  2. Grab the peg with the gripper
    #  3. Move the peg to the side of the hole
    #  4. Pull the peg out of the hole from the side
    # First, put the gripper above the peg.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg"):

    # If the peg becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper
    # above the peg.
    # Because the peg is a long object, check if the gripper is lined up with it
    # from the front instead of around it.
