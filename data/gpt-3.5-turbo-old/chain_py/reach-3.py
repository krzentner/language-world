I believe this function was already implemented earlier. Here it is again for your reference:

```
def reach(robot):
    # Steps:
    # 1. Reach towards the target
    # We don't have any objects to manipulate, so we can just move the robot's
    # gripper directly to the target location
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the reach target"):
        robot.reach("to the goal")
```

Is there anything else you need help with?
