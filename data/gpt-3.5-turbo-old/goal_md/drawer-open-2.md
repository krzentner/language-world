The robot should perform the following steps to reliably pull open a drawer:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.

To put the gripper above the drawer handle, the robot should move its gripper until it is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.

Next, the robot should drop its gripper around the drawer handle. The robot should move its gripper until it is around the drawer handle to have a good grip on it.

Finally, the robot should pull the drawer open by moving its gripper in the direction away from the drawer handle.
