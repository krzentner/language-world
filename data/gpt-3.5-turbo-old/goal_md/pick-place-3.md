To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps: 

1. Put gripper above puck. 
2. Drop gripper around puck. 
3. Close gripper around puck. 
4. Move puck to goal.

First, put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to pick it up. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until it is above the puck.

If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the puck and the gripper is closed. 

If the gripper is near the puck and closed, maybe we can grab it, so check if the gripper is above the puck and closed, then move the gripper to the target location. 
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and closed, move the robot's gripper until it is near the target location.
