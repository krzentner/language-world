To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Put gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around the mug handle
3. Close gripper around the mug handle
4. Check if mug is stable in gripper
5. Move gripper above target location
6. Release gripper to drop mug at target location

First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the mug handle
If the gripper isn't around the mug handle, put it around the mug handle.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Check if the mug is stable in the gripper. Make sure it's not slipping or falling.
- If the mug is not stable in the gripper, adjust the gripper until the mug can be held securely.
Once the mug is securely held in the gripper, move the gripper above the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is gripping the mug handle and the target location is not below the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
Finally, release the gripper to drop the mug at the target location.
