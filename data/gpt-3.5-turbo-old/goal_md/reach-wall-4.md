    Steps:  1. Move the robot's gripper to the top of the wall  2. Reach towards the target
    First, the robot needs to position its gripper at the top of the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the wall
    Once the gripper is positioned at the top of the wall, the robot can reach towards the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the wall and not near the target, move the robot's gripper until it's near the target location.
