To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move the gripper above the target location 4. Lower the gripper and slide the plate back into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    Once the gripper is above the plate, we can grab it by closing the gripper around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the target location, we can slide the plate back by moving the gripper above the target location and lowering the gripper to slide the plate back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the robot's gripper is above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is above the target location, we can lower the gripper and slide the plate back into the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper has lowered enough to slide the plate back into the target location.
