To slide the plate back into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
Steps: 1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab plate with gripper  3. Slide plate back to target location  4. Release plate
First, put the robot's gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
If the robot's gripper is not holding the plate, grab the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the target location, slide it back to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location and the target location is in front of the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location with the plate
Finally, release the plate.
- When the plate is in the target location and the robot's gripper is holding the plate, release the plate.
