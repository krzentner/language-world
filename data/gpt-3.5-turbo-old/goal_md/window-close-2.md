Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:
1. Put the gripper left of the window handle.
2. If the window handle is not near the gripper, move the gripper near the window handle.
3. When the gripper is near the window handle, move the gripper until it is forward aligned with the window handle.
4. If the window handle is still to the left of the gripper, move the gripper almost vertically aligned with the window handle.
5. Push harder to close the window.
6. When the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle, move the gripper until it is forward aligned with the window handle.
