Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the window closed to the right reliably:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper left of the window handle
           2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window
           3. Push the window closed harder
           If the window handle is right of the robot's gripper, we should move the gripper near the window handle to start pushing
           - When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is right of the window handle
           If the robot's gripper is near the window handle we can probably slide the window close now by moving the gripper right.
           - When the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle
           If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
           - When the robot's gripper is near the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the window handle.
