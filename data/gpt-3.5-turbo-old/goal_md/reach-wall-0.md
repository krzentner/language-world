    Steps:  1. Move the gripper along the top of the wall until it's above the target location  2. Move the gripper down to the target location
    If the gripper can't reach the target location due to the wall, first move the gripper along the top of the wall until it's above the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper along the top of the wall until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Then, move the gripper down to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the target location
