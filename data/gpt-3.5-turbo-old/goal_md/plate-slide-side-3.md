To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a large object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the front instead of around it.
    - When plate is not left of the robot's gripper and plate is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When plate is horizontally aligned with target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with target location.
