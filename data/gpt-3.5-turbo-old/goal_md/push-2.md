Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the puck to the target location:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Slide puck to goal
4. If the gripper is not above the puck and not vertically aligned with the puck, move the robot's gripper until it is vertically aligned with the puck and above it
5. If the gripper is not around the puck and open, move the robot's gripper until it is near the puck and closed
6. If the gripper is near the puck and closed, move the robot's gripper until it is above the target location.
