To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck on the other side of the wall, so that the gripper's line of sight to the puck is unobstructed by the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck and the gripper's line of sight to the puck is obstructed by the wall, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck on the other side of the wall
2. Use the gripper to pick up the puck and hold it securely.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the puck and closed
3. Move the gripper around the wall to the target location while holding the puck securely.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, move the robot's gripper over the wall and down towards the target location, making sure to keep the puck securely held within the gripper.
4. Release the puck at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the puck is within the gripper, open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
