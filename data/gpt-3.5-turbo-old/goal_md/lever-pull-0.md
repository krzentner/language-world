To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the lever handle   2. Pull upwards on the lever handle
    First, put the gripper around the lever handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever handle
    Once the gripper is around the lever handle, pull upwards on the lever handle to rotate it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, move the robot's gripper upwards to rotate the lever upwards.
