To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Move gripper above handle 2. Drop gripper around handle 3. Push down on the handle
    First, move the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, move the gripper down around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle to perform the task.
