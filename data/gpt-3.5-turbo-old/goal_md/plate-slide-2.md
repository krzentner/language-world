To slide the plate into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the plate  2. Move the gripper down and trap the plate between the gripper  3. Slide the plate to the goal location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is open, close it to trap the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is trapped around the plate, we can slide the plate to the goal location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the goal location and the plate is trapped between the robot's gripper, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the goal location and release the plate.
