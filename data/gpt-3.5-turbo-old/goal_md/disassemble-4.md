To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Move the gripper horizontally away from the peg while pulling the wrench vertically up  4. Release the wrench from the gripper
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is aligned with the wrench, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    To pull the wrench off the peg, we need to move the gripper horizontally away from the peg while pulling the wrench vertically up.
    - While the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, move the robot's gripper horizontally away from the peg while pulling the wrench vertically up
    Once the wrench is free from the peg, release it from the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the target location and the robot's gripper is closed around the wrench, release the wrench from the gripper.
