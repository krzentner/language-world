    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle on the side  2. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper near the handle on the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle on the side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle on the side
    Now that the gripper is near the handle, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle on the side, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is pressing down on the handle.
