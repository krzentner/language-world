To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above wrench and peg, with wrench close to the peg  2. Slide wrench down around peg  3. Close gripper around wrench  4. Lift wrench with peg attached
    First, put the gripper above the wrench and the peg, with the wrench close to the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not roughly above the wrench and the peg, move the robot's gripper until it is
    Once above the wrench and the peg, slide the wrench down around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the wrench, move the robot's gripper until it is around the peg and the wrench
    Close the gripper around the wrench once it's around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the wrench but not close, close the gripper
    Finally, lift the wrench with the peg attached.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed and around the wrench and the peg, move the robot's gripper until it is above the desired location and then open the gripper to drop the peg.
