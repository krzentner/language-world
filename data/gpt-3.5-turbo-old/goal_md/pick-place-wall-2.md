To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck and close gripper
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck, close the gripper to pick up the puck

2. Move the gripper over the wall to the target location
    - When the target location is on the other side of the wall, move the gripper over the wall until the gripper is above the target location
    - If the gripper cannot move over the wall, the robot should find a different path or solution to deliver the object accurately to the target location.

3. Open gripper to drop the puck
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, open the gripper to drop the puck at the target location.
