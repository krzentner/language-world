To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the box lid
2. Grab the box lid with the gripper
3. Move the gripper to the top of the box
4. Release the box lid onto the box

First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box lid
If the gripper isn't already closed around the lid, grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is closed
Next, move the gripper to the top of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is around the box lid, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the box
Finally, release the box lid onto the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box, release the box lid onto the box.
