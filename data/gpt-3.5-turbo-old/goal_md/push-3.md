To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper above the puck
2. Move the gripper down around the puck
3. Close the gripper around the puck
4. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the puck
5. If the gripper is not near the puck, move the gripper until it is near the puck and closed
6. Slide the gripper down to trap the puck
7. Move the gripper towards the target location while keeping the puck trapped
8. If the gripper is not above the target location, move the gripper until it is above the target location
9. Release the puck by opening the gripper at the target location.
