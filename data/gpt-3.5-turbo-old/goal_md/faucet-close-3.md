To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet knob  2. Turn right to close the faucet
    First, put the gripper around the faucet knob.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet knob, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the faucet knob and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob right to close the faucet.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the faucet knob, turn the knob right until the faucet is closed.
