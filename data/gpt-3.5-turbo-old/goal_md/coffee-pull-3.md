To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper around the handle of the mug
2. Lift up the mug to clear the table
3. Move the gripper towards the target location
4. Lower the mug to the target location

First, put the gripper around the handle of the mug. 
- When the robot's gripper is not around the mug handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and the robot's gripper is closed
Once the gripper is around the handle of the mug, lift up the mug to clear the table.
- When the robot's gripper is closed and the mug is not lifted, move the robot's gripper upwards until the mug is lifted
Next, move the gripper towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is not near it, move the robot's gripper until the mug is near the target location
Finally, lower the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper downwards until the mug is resting on the target location.
