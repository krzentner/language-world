To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Put gripper above the peg  4. Lower the wrench until it surrounds the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Then, grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Next, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg
    Finally, lower the wrench until it surrounds the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the wrench is not surrounding the peg, move the robot's gripper until the wrench surrounds the peg
