To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper near the handle  2. Turn gripper to be vertical with handle  3. Push down on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper near the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle
    Once the gripper is near the handle, turn the gripper so that it is vertical with the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, turn the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now, push down on the handle from the side to complete the task.
