To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the dial handle  2. Turn the dial to the desired position
    First, put the gripper around the dial handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial handle and the gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the dial handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the dial handle, turn the dial to the desired position.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial handle, turn the dial until it reaches the desired position
