To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the handle 2. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Now that the gripper is lined up, just push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the handle.
