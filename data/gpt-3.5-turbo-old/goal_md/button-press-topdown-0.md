The robot should perform the following steps to push the button down from above:
1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
2. Push down on the button from the top

To elaborate on these steps:
- First, the robot needs to position the gripper so that it is directly above the button to be pressed.
- To achieve this, the robot should move the gripper until it is vertically aligned with the button.
- Once the gripper is aligned, the robot can close it around the button and press down from above to activate it.
