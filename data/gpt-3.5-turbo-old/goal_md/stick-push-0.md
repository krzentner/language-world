To push the thermos to the target location using the stick reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the stick behind the thermos and align it with the center.
    - When the stick is not behind the thermos, move the stick towards the thermos.
    - When the stick is not aligned with the center of the thermos, rotate it until it is aligned.
    
2. Push the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
    - When the thermos is not near the target location, move the stick with the thermos towards the target location.
