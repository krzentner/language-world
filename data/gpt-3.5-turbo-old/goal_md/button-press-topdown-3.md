1. Line up the gripper as viewed from above
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is closed
2. Push down on the button from the top
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the button
