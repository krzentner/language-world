The robot can use the stick to push the thermos to the target location. The following steps can be performed by the robot to complete the task `stick-push`:

Steps:
1. Put the gripper near the stick's handle
2. Open the gripper and attach it to the stick's handle
3. Move the robot's gripper to the thermos
4. Position the stick's end to touch the thermos's side
5. Push the thermos to the target location with the stick
6. Once the thermos is at the target location, detach the gripper from the stick's handle and move the gripper away

If the gripper is not near the stick's handle, move it near. Then the gripper needs to be attached to the stick's handle by opening it and grasping the handle. Once the gripper is attached to the stick, the robot should move the gripper to the thermos. The next step is to position the stick's end to touch the thermos's side. Using the stick's end, the robot can slide the thermos to the target location. Once the thermos is at the target location, the robot should detach the gripper from the stick's handle and move the gripper away.
