    Steps:  1. Put gripper right of the window handle 
    Move the robot's gripper to the right of the window handle so that it can start pushing against it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not almost vertically aligned with the window handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is almost vertically aligned with the window handle, the robot can start pushing against it.
    - Push the window handle to the left
