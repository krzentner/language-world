To push the door closed to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper roughly around the door handle  2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the door handle
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from in front, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the door handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the door handle.
