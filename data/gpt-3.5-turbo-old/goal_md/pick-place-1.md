To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
2. Drop the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
3. Close the gripper around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the target location
4. Move the puck to the target location.
