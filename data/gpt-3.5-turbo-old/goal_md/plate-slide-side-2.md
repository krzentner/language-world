Here are the steps the robot should perform to slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably:
    
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways to the target location
    
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    If the plate is not between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate.
    - When the plate is not between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is not forward aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the plate is between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed.
    - When the plate is between the robot and the target location and the robot's gripper is near the plate, move the robot's gripper sideways until the plate reaches the target location.
