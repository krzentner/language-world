To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around the faucet handle  2. Turn the handle left
    First, put the gripper around the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is around the faucet handle, we can turn the handle left to open the faucet.
    - Turn the handle left until the water flows
