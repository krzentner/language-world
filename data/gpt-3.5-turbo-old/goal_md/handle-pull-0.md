To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Drop gripper around handle  3. Pull the handle up
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the handle
    Once the gripper is above the handle, we can grab it by moving the gripper down around the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the handle
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can just pull it up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, move the robot's gripper until the handle is pulled up completely.
