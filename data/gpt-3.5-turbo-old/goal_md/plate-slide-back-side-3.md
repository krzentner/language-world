To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
    Once the gripper is lined up above the plate, grab the plate with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the robot's gripper is not around the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the plate
    If the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it back sideways into the target location. 
    - When the plate is held securely by the gripper, move the robot's gripper until the plate is back sideways into the target location.
