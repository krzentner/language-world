To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper above the wrench  2. Open gripper and drop the wrench around the peg  3. Close gripper to ensure wrench is snug
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Then, drop the gripper around the peg and ensure that the gripper is closed and the wrench is snug around the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, close the gripper around the peg to ensure the wrench is snug.
