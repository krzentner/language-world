To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above peg  2. Grab wrench with gripper  3. Align wrench with peg  4. Drop wrench around peg
    First, put the gripper above the peg. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the peg
    After that, the robot should grab the wrench with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not holding the wrench and the robot's gripper is above the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench
    Once the robot has the wrench, it should align the wrench with the peg.
    - When the wrench and the peg are not horizontally aligned, move the robot's gripper until the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg
    Finally, the robot should drop the wrench around the peg.
    - When the wrench is horizontally aligned with the peg and the gripper is not holding the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is closed around the peg
