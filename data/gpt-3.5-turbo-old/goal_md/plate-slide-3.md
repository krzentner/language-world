To slide the plate into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper lightly against plate to trap it between the gripper and the target location  3. Slide plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate so that we don't bump the plate while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the plate
    If the gripper is not near the plate, move it down to the plate to slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is almost closed
    If the gripper is almost closed on the plate, we should be able to slide the plate to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is closed on the plate, move the robot's gripper until the plate is trapped between the gripper and the target location
    Now that the plate is trapped between the gripper and the target location, just slide the plate to the target location by moving the gripper.
