To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above puck
2. Push gripper into top of puck
3. Slide puck backwards to goal

The same steps as `push`, but instead of moving the puck to the left or right, we move it backwards towards the target location. We need to make sure the gripper is above the puck, put the gripper around the puck if it isn't already there, and then slide the puck backwards to the goal.
