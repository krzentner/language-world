To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Slide the plate horizontally to the target location
First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate
If the gripper is not around the plate, grab the plate with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the plate and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the plate and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is around the plate, we can slide it to the target location.
- When the plate is not in the target location, move the robot's gripper until the plate is at the target location.
