The robot should perform the following steps to pull the drawer open reliably:
1. Put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Drop the gripper around the drawer handle.
3. Pull open the drawer.
    - If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle.
    - Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle, move the gripper down around the drawer handle.
    - If the gripper is not around the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is around the drawer handle.
    - Once the gripper is around the drawer handle, pull the drawer open.
    - If the gripper is not horizontally aligned with the drawer handle, move the robot's gripper until the gripper is horizontally aligned with the drawer handle.
