To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put the gripper around the lever  2. Pull the gripper up to rotate the lever up
    First, the robot should move the gripper around the lever to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is closed.
    Once the gripper is around the lever, the robot should pull it up to rotate the lever up.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the lever, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever and the robot's gripper is closed. Then pull the gripper upward to rotate the lever up.
