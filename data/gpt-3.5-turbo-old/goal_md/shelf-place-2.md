To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the block  2. Grab the block with the gripper  3. Raise the gripper off the shelf  4. Move the gripper to the target location  5. Lower the gripper to place the block at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the block, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the block
    If the gripper isn't around the block, put it around the block.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the block and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the block and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is gripping the block, raise the gripper off the shelf to avoid collisions.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the block, raise the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is clear of the shelf
    Move the gripper to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is clear of the shelf, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
    Lower the gripper to place the block at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target location, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is touching the target location and the robot's gripper is open
