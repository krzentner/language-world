The task `bin-picking` can be performed using the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above cube  2. Open gripper  3. Move gripper down to cube  4. Close gripper around cube  5. Lift cube  6. Move gripper to target bin  7. Lower gripper into target bin  8. Open gripper to release cube

First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
If the gripper is not around the cube, move the gripper down to the cube, open the gripper, and grab the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open
Once the gripper has the cube, lift it up.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the bin
Move the gripper to the target bin and lower the gripper into it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is at the correct height and the robot's gripper is closed
Open the gripper to release the cube into the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is at the correct height and the robot's gripper is above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is open
