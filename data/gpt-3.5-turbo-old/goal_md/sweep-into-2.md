To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Put the gripper above the cube 2. Drop gripper around cube 3. Close the gripper around cube 4. Move the cube to goal 
First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
If the gripper isn't around the cube, put it around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
If the gripper is near the cube and open, maybe we can grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target location
