To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench
    Once the gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench, grab the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is around the wrench and the robot's gripper is closed
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, lift the wrench off the peg and move it to the desired location.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is open
