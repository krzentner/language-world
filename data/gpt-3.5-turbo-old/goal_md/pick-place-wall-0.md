To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above puck  2. Drop gripper around puck  3. Close gripper around puck  4. Move puck up and over the wall to the goal location
    First, put the gripper above the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the puck
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, move the gripper down around it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the puck and closed, we can pick it up now.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper up and over the wall to the goal location. We might have to move sideways to avoid the wall as well.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the goal location, move the robot's gripper down to place the puck at the goal location.
