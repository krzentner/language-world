To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Locate the cube
    - When the cube is not in vision, move the robot's gripper until the cube is in vision
2. Put gripper above the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the cube
3. Drop gripper around the cube
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is closed
4. Close gripper around cube
5. Lift gripper with cube
6. Move gripper to the target bin
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the target bin, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the target bin
7. Drop the cube into the target bin 
    - Open the gripper to release the cube into the bin
8. Move gripper away from bin 

It's important to note that the exact positioning and movement of the gripper depends on the specific design of the robot and the objects being manipulated. These steps provide a general guideline for reliable object manipulation in a bin-picking scenario.
