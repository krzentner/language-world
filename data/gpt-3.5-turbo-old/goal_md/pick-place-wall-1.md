To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 
    1. Put the gripper above the puck on the side of the wall
    2. Move the gripper over the wall while lowering it to grab the puck
    3. Lift the gripper and puck over the wall
    4. Move the gripper to the target location while keeping the puck level to avoid dropping it
    5. Lower the gripper to place the puck at the target location
    First, put the gripper above the puck on the side of the wall, where there is enough space to slide the gripper over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck on the side of the wall, move the robot's gripper until it is above the puck on the side of the wall
    Once the gripper is above the puck, move the gripper over the wall while lowering it to grab the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not over the wall and not holding the puck, move the robot's gripper over the wall while lowering it to grab the puck
    Now that the gripper has picked up the puck, lift the gripper and puck over the wall.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the puck and is above the wall, move the robot's gripper until it is on the other side of the wall
    While moving the gripper to the target location, keep the puck level to avoid dropping it. 
    - When the robot's gripper is not at the target location, move the robot's gripper to the target location while keeping the puck level
    Lastly, lower the gripper to place the puck at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the target location, move the robot's gripper until it is above the target location and lower the gripper to place the puck at the target location.
