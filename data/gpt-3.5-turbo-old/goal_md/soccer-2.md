To push the soccer ball into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the soccer ball  2. Drop gripper around the soccer ball  3. Close gripper around the soccer ball  4. Move the soccer ball to the goal
    First, put the gripper above the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the soccer ball, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball
    If the gripper isn't around the soccer ball, put it around the soccer ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is open, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is near the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed
    If the gripper is near the soccer ball and closed, maybe we can push the soccer ball to the target.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the soccer ball and the robot's gripper is closed, move the robot's gripper until the robot's gripper is close to the target location
    If the gripper is close to the target location, we've probably trapped the soccer ball and can push it to the target. Open the gripper to release the soccer ball in the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the target location while holding the soccer ball, open the gripper to release the soccer ball in the target location.
