To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Line up gripper with handle from the side  2. Push down on the handle
    Because this is a "side" task, the gripper needs to line up with the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is not horizontally aligned with the handle, the robot should move gripper to the side of the handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle from the side, simply push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the handle, the robot should push down on the handle.
