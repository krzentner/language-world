To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Move gripper to the dial. 2. Grab the dial with the gripper. 3. Turn the dial in the appropriate direction.

First, move the gripper near the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move the gripper to the dial.
Once the gripper is near the dial, grab it securely.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the dial with the gripper.
Check the desired direction to turn the dial, then turn it in that direction.
- When the robot has securely grabbed the dial with the gripper, turn the dial in the appropriate direction.
