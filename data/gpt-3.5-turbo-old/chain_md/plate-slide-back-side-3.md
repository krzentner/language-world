To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways towards the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate becomes too far from the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. 
    - When the plate is not below the robot's gripper and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should grab plate.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with target location, the robot should align plate to target location.
    If the plate is lined up with the target location to the side, slide it towards the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate sideways towards the target location.
