To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 1. Hold the hammer above the nail  2. Move the hammer down to hit the nail

First, the robot should hold the hammer roughly above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.

Once the hammer is roughly above the nail, the robot should move the hammer down to hit the nail with the correct amount of force.
- When the robot's gripper is above the nail, the robot should hit the nail with the hammer.

It's important for the robot to be precise with its movements so that it hits the nail accurately and with the right amount of force.
