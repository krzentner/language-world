Here are the steps the robot should perform to pull the door open reliably:

1. Put the gripper mostly above the door handle.
2. If the gripper isn't almost vertically aligned with the door handle, move it until it is.
3. Once the gripper is almost lined up, close it around the door handle.
4. Pull the door open while the gripper is still around the handle.
