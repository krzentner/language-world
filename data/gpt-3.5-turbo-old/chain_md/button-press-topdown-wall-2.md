To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Position the robot's gripper directly above the button while also being close to the wall.
2. Move the gripper down until it makes contact with the button.
3. Push down on the button with the gripper while also applying pressure inward towards the wall to prevent the gripper from slipping off the button.
4. Release the gripper from the button and lift the gripper back up.
