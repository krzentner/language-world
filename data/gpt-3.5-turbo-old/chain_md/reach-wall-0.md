To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the robot's gripper is already above the target location.
2. If the gripper is not above the target location, move the gripper towards the target location.
3. If the gripper encounters the wall before reaching the target location, move the gripper up to go over the wall.
4. Move the gripper back down towards the target location.
5. If the gripper encounters the wall again, move the gripper over the wall again and continue moving towards the target location.
6. Once the gripper is above the target location, stop moving and complete the task.
