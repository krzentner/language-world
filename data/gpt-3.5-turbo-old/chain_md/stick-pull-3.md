Steps: 
1. Position the gripper above the stick.
2. Grab the stick with the gripper.
3. Move the stick towards the thermos until it comes in contact with it.
4. Use the stick to hook onto the handle of the thermos.
5. Pull the thermos towards the target location using the stick.
6. Once the thermos reaches the target location, release the stick and drop the thermos.
