The robot should perform the following steps to slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably:

Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate
2. Move gripper down towards the plate
3. Place gripper around the plate
4. Move the plate towards the target location
5. If the gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, adjust the grip and verify the plate is still properly positioned
6. When the plate is in the target location, release the grip on the plate 

First, put the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.

Once the gripper is above the plate, move it down towards the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper down towards the plate.

Place the gripper around the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the plate and the gripper is open, the robot should place gripper around the plate.

Move the plate towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is around the plate, the robot should move the plate towards the target location.

If the gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, adjust the grip and verify the plate is still properly positioned.
- When the robot's gripper starts to lose grip on the plate, the robot should adjust the grip on the plate and verify that it is still properly positioned.

When the plate is in the target location, release the grip on the plate.
- When the plate is in the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should release the grip on the plate.
