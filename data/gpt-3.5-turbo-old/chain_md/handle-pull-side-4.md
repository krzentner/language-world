To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Move gripper to one side of the handle  3. Grab the handle with the gripper  4. Pull up on the handle from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Move the gripper to one side of the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is not near the side of the handle, the robot should move gripper to one side of the handle.
    Grab the handle with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab handle.
    Finally, pull up on the handle from the side.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the handle, the robot should pull handle up from the side.
