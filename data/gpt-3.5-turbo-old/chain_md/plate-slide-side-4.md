To reliably slide the plate sideways into the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Line the plate up with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above plate.
    If the plate is to the right of the gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left of the plate.
    - When the plate is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the plate, the robot should move gripper to left of plate.
    As long as the gripper is still mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, line up the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should align plate to target location.
    If the plate is already horizontally aligned with the target location, slide it into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide plate into the target location.
