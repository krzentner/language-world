The task `dial-turn` requires the robot to turn the dial to a specific position.
To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper around dial  2. Turn dial to the target position
    First, put the gripper around the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should put gripper around dial.
    Turn the dial to the target position. Depending on the direction and distance to turn the dial, the robot should use different levels of force and precision.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn dial to the target position using appropriate force and precision.
