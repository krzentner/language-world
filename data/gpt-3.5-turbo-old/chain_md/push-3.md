To slide the puck to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Put gripper above puck
2. If the gripper is not above the puck, move the gripper above the puck
3. Drop gripper around puck
4. If the gripper is not around the puck, place the gripper around the puck
5. Close gripper around puck
6. If the gripper is not near the puck or not vertically aligned with the puck, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it
7. If the gripper is near the puck, trap the puck by pushing down on it from above and move the gripper to slide the puck
8. If the puck is below the gripper, slide the puck to the target location.
