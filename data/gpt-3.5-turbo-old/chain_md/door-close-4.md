To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put the gripper roughly around the door handle 2. Push the door closed
    If the gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the door is large and we're just pushing it (unlike when opening the door).
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should grab the door handle.
    If the door is aligned with the gripper as seen from behind, we can push the door closed.
    - When the robot's gripper is backward aligned with the door handle, the robot should push the door closed.
