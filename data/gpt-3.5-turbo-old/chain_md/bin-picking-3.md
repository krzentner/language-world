    Steps:  1. Locate the cube and the target bin  2. Move gripper above the cube  3. Center the gripper above the cube  4. Move the gripper down and grab the cube  5. Lift the cube above the bin and center it over the bin  6. Move the gripper down and release the cube into the bin
    First, locate the cube and the target bin.
    - When the robot doesn't know the location of the cube or the target bin, the robot should locate the cube and the target bin.
    Move the gripper above the cube and center it directly above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not centered above the cube, the robot should center the gripper above the cube.
    Move the gripper down and grab the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should move the gripper down and grab the cube.
    Lift the cube above the bin and center it over the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should lift the cube above the bin and center it over the bin.
    Move the gripper down and release the cube into the bin.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper down and release the cube into the bin.
