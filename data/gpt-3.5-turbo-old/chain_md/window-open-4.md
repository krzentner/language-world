The robot should perform the following steps to slide the window open to the left reliably:

1. Put gripper right of the window handle
2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window
3. Push the window open harder 

If the robot's gripper is not vertically lined up with the window handle, the gripper should be moved near the window handle to start pushing. If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, it can probably slide the window open now by moving the gripper left. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, it should push harder.
