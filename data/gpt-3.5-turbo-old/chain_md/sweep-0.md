The task `sweep` requires the robot to grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location. To achieve this, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:
1. Place the gripper above the cube. 
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.

2. Close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.

3. Lift the cube and move it towards the target location.
- When the gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should lift it off the ground.
- Move the cube sideways to reach the target location.

4. Release the cube.
- When the cube reaches the target location, the robot should release the gripper to place the cube. 

By following these steps, the robot can reliably grab the cube and move it to the target location.
