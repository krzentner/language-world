To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the target location is above the short wall. If it is not, move to a location from where the target location is visible.
2. Move to the edge of the wall closest to the target location.
3. Reach over the wall to the target location.
4. If the gripper is not close enough to the target location, move the gripper closer to the target location.
5. Once the gripper is close enough, open the gripper to release any object that may have been picked up during the reach.
