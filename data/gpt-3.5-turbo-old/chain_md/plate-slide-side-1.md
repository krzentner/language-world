To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Align plate with the target location  4. Slide the plate sideways into the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put the gripper above the plate.
    If the plate becomes left of the gripper, go back to putting the gripper above the plate. Because the plate is a flat object, check if the gripper is lined up with it from the side instead of around it.
    - When the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the plate is not vertically aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the plate.
    As long the gripper is mostly around the plate and the plate isn't lined up with the target location, align the plate with the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should align the plate with the target location.
    If the plate is aligned with the target location, slide it sideways into the target location.
    - When the plate is horizontally aligned with the target location, the robot should slide the plate into the target location.
