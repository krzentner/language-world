To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the peg  2. Grab the peg with the gripper  3. Pull the peg out from the hole sideways
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above the peg.
    Grab the peg with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the peg.
    Once the gripper is around the peg, we can pull it out sideways from the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the peg, the robot should pull the peg out sideways from the hole.
