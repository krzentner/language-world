To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
   1. Put gripper above puck
   2. Drop gripper around puck
   3. Close gripper around puck
   4. Lift gripper and puck over the wall
   5. Move gripper and puck to goal
   6. Lower the gripper and release the puck at the target location

First, put the gripper above the puck, so that we do not hit the wall while trying to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
If the gripper is close to the puck, close the gripper to grab it.
    - When the robot's gripper is close to the puck and the gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the puck.
Now that we have the puck, we need to lift it over the wall to the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper and the puck is near the wall, the robot should lift the gripper and puck over the wall.
Move the gripper and puck to the target location.
    - When the robot and puck are lifted over the wall towards the target location, the robot should move gripper and puck to goal.
Once we reach the target location, we should lower the gripper and release the puck to place it at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper and puck have reached the target location, the robot should lower the gripper and release the puck.
