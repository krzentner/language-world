To reach the target location with a short wall in the way, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Check if the target location is reachable without crossing the wall.
2. If the target location is reachable, then proceed with the normal `reach` task.
3. If the wall is blocking the path to the target location, move the robot's gripper to a position that allows it to reach over the wall.
4. Once the gripper is over the wall and above the target location, proceed with the normal `reach` task to move the gripper to the target location.
5. Finally, move the gripper back down to the ground to complete the task.
