To slide the window closed to the right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper left of the window handle.
2. Start pushing against the window handle to close the window.
3. If the window handle is right of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not near the window handle, move the gripper to the left of the window handle.
4. If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, slide the window right.
5. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder.
6. When the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, the robot should push the window right harder.
