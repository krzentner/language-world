To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps: 
1. Put gripper above the cube 
2. Grab the cube with the gripper 
3. Move the cube towards the target location 
4. Move the cube sideways to the target location 
5. Release the cube 

First, put the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
Once the gripper is above the cube, grab the cube with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
Try to move the cube towards the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the target location, the robot should move the cube towards the target location.
If the cube is near the target location, move it sideways to the goal.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should move the cube sideways to the goal.
Release the cube at the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is at the goal location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
