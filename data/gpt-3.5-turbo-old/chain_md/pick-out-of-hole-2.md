To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above the peg 2. Grab the top of the peg with the gripper 3. Raise the peg out of the hole 4. Move the peg to the target location 5. Release the gripper to drop the peg in place
    First, put the gripper above the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
    Once the gripper is above the peg, grab it from the top with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the peg, the robot should grab the top of the peg with the gripper.
    Raise the gripper to lift the peg out of the hole.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the peg, the robot should raise the gripper to lift the peg out of the hole.
    Move the gripper and the peg to the target location.
    - When the peg is out of the hole and the gripper is holding it, the robot should move the gripper and the peg to the target location.
    Release the gripper to drop the peg in place.
    - When the peg is at the target location, the robot should release the gripper to drop the peg in place.
