To push the door closed to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper on the door handle
If the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, move it to the door handle
- When the robot's gripper is not near the door handle, the robot should move gripper to the door handle.

2. Push the door closed
If the door is aligned with the gripper, push it closed.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the door and the door is not completely closed, the robot should push the door closed. 

3. Check if the door is closed
If the door is not completely closed, go back to step 2. If it is closed, the task has been completed.
