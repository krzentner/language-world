To slide the puck to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above the puck.
2. Drop gripper around the puck.
3. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, align the gripper with the puck.
4. If the gripper is not close to the puck, move the gripper down to the puck to slide it.
5. If the gripper is not yet grasping the puck, push the gripper into the top of the puck to trap it.
6. Close the gripper to ensure control over the puck.
7. Move the gripper and the puck to the target location.
8. If necessary, release the gripper to release the puck.
