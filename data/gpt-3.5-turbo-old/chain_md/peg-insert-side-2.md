To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
1. Place the gripper above the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
2. Grab the peg with the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the peg, the robot should close the gripper to grab the peg.
3. Line up the peg with the hole.
- When the gripper is holding the peg, align the peg sideways with the hole.
4. Slide the peg sideways into the hole.
- When the peg is aligned with the hole, slide it sideways into the hole while holding it with gripper.
5. Release the gripper to place the peg inside the hole.
- After inserting the peg into the hole, release the gripper to let go of the peg. It should be in place inside the hole now.
