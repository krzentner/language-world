The steps required for the robot to pull up the handle reliably are as follows:

    1. Put gripper above the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    
    - When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    
    2. Grab the handle with the gripper
    Once the gripper is above the handle, close the gripper to grab the handle.
    
    - When the robot's gripper is above handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should grab the handle.
    
    3. Pull up the handle
    Once the grip is closed around the handle, pull up the handle until it stops.
    
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the handle, the robot should pull up the handle until it stops.
