To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Position the robot under the hoop with the gripper near the ball  2. Raise the robot's arm to the appropriate height  3. Shoot the ball towards the hoop
    First, position the robot under the hoop with the gripper near the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the ball and the robot is not under the hoop, the robot should move to the appropriate position under the hoop with the gripper near the ball.
    Once the robot is under the hoop with the gripper near the ball, raise the robot's arm to the appropriate height for shooting.
    - When the robot's arm is not raised to the appropriate height for shooting, the robot should raise its arm.
    Finally, shoot the ball towards the hoop to try to make a basket.
    - When the robot's arm is at the appropriate height, the robot should shoot the ball towards the hoop.
