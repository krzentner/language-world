First, put the gripper above the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box lid, the robot should put gripper above the box lid.
If the gripper isn't around the box lid, put it around the box lid.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the box lid.
Once the gripper is around the box lid, try to grab it by closing the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is near the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around box lid.
Once the box lid is held securely by the gripper, raise the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the box lid, the robot should raise the gripper with box lid.
Now, put the gripper above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the box, the robot should put gripper above the box.
Lower the box lid onto the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box, the robot should lower the box lid onto the box.
