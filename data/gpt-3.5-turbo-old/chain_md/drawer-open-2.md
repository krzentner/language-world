I'm sorry, it seems like a mistake. The task `drawer-open` was already defined and it appears again. However, to answer your question, to pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put gripper above drawer handle
2. Drop gripper around drawer handle
3. Pull open the drawer
