I'm sorry, it looks like you already provided the steps for the `drawer-open` task in your original prompt. Here are the steps again:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above drawer handle  2. Drop gripper around drawer handle  3. Pull open the drawer

1. First, put the gripper above the drawer handle.
2. Once the gripper is lined up above the drawer handle, move the gripper down around the handle to grab it.
3. Pull the gripper away from the drawer to open it.
