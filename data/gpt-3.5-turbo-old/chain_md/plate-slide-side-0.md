The robot should perform the following steps to slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the plate  2. Grab the plate with the gripper  3. Move gripper to side of the plate  4. Move the plate to the target location
    First, put the gripper above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should put gripper above the plate.
    If the plate isn't grasped by the gripper, grab it with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the gripper isn't around the plate, the robot should grab the plate.
    Move the gripper to the side of the plate. We don't need to be careful about the direction, since the plate is large and we're just sliding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the plate and the robot's gripper is not at the side of the plate, the robot should move gripper to side of the plate.
    Slide the plate to the target location. We also don't need to be careful about the direction, since the plate is flat and we're just sliding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the side of the plate and the plate is not at the target location, the robot should slide the plate to the target location.
