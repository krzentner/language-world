I'm sorry but your task `sweep-into` is not defined. However, you can follow the general approach of breaking down the task into smaller steps and performing them one by one based on the current state of the robot's gripper and object's location. The steps could include: 
1. Move the gripper above the cube.
2. Grab the cube with the gripper.
3. Move the cube towards the target location.
4. Drop the cube at the target location.
You can also add additional steps as necessary to improve the reliability of the task.
