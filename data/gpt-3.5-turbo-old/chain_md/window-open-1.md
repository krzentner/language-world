The robot should perform the following steps to slide the window open to the left reliably:
1. Put the gripper right of the window handle.
2. Start pushing against the window handle to open the window.
3. If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, slide the window open by moving the gripper left.
4. If the robot's gripper is starting to be in front of the window handle, push harder to slide the window open.
