To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the wrench  2. Grab the wrench with the gripper  3. Lift the wrench off the peg
    First, put the gripper above the wrench.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
    Once the gripper is around the wrench, we can try to lift it off the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is around wrench, the robot should grab wrench.
    Now that we've grabbed the wrench, lift it upwards to remove it from the peg.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should lift the wrench off the peg.
