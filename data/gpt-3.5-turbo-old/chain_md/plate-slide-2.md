To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above plate  2. Push gripper down onto plate  3. Slide plate to goal
    First, put the gripper roughly above the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate, the robot should place gripper above plate.
    If the gripper is not pushing down onto the plate, push down onto the plate.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the robot's gripper is not pushing down onto the plate, the robot should push down onto the plate.
    Once the gripper is pushing down onto the plate, slide the plate to the goal.
    - When the robot's gripper is pushing down onto the plate, the robot should slide the plate to the goal.
