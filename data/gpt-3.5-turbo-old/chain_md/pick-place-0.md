To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we do not bump it while trying to grab it.
   - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
2. Move the gripper down and around the puck to pick it up.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the gripper is not around the puck, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
3. Close the gripper around the puck to hold it securely.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the puck and open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
4. Move the puck to the target location.
   - When the gripper is closed around the puck and the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should move the puck to the target location.
5. Open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
