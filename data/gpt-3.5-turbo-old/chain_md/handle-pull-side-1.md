    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Pull the handle up from the side
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is around the handle, we can pull the handle up from the side using a pulling motion.
