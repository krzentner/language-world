To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Place the hammer above the nail  2. Grasp the handle of the hammer  3. Lift the hammer  4. Move the hammer above the nail  5. Swing the hammer down to hit the nail  6. Repeat steps 4-5 until nail is completely driven in
    First, put the hammer above the nail so that it's ready to swing down.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.
    Once the hammer is above the nail, grasp the handle of the hammer with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the nail and not grasping the handle, the robot should grasp the handle of the hammer.
    Lift the hammer so that it has room to swing down and hit the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper is grasping the handle of the hammer and not lifted, the robot should lift the hammer.
    Move the hammer above the nail, making sure it's lined up with the nail.
    - When the robot's gripper has lifted the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, the robot should move the hammer above the nail and align it.
    Swing the hammer down to hit the nail. Repeat steps 4-5 until the nail is completely driven in.
    - When the hammer has hit the nail but the nail is not completely driven in, the robot should repeat steps 4-5 until the nail is completely driven in.
