To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

    Steps:  1. Put gripper on faucet handle  2. Turn gripper to the right until faucet is closed
    First, the robot should move the gripper to the faucet handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle, the robot should move the gripper to the faucet handle.
    Once the gripper is on the faucet handle, turn the gripper to the right until the faucet is closed.
    - While the faucet is not closed, turn gripper to the right.
