To push down the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above the handle  2. Grab the handle with the gripper  3. Push down on the handle
    First, put the gripper above the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
    Once the gripper is lined up with the handle, grab the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around handle, the robot should grab handle.
    Now that the gripper is around the handle, push down on the handle.
    - When the robot's gripper is around handle, the robot should push down on handle.
