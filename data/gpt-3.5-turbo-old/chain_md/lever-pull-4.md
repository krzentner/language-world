1. Place the gripper around the lever handle
- When the robot's gripper is not around the lever handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around lever handle.
2. Rotate the gripper upwards
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever handle, the robot should rotate the gripper upwards to rotate the lever up.
