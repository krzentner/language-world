To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps:  1. Put gripper above button, near wall  2. Tilt gripper to clear the wall  3. Push down on the button from the top
    Because there's a short wall in the way, we need to first put the gripper above the button, as close to the wall as possible.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with button and the robot's gripper is not near the wall, the robot should put gripper above button, near the wall.
    Then, tilt the gripper to clear the wall and move it closer to the button.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the button and the robot's gripper is not vertical, the robot should tilt gripper to clear the wall.
    Finally, push down on the button as usual.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button.
