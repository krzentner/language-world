To slide the puck backwards to the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:
    Steps: 1. Put gripper above puck
    We need to put the gripper above the puck before we can slide it.
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
    If the gripper isn't around the puck, put it around the puck.
    - When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
    If the gripper is near the puck, we can slide it backwards. Move the gripper downwards, and slide the puck while holding it.
    - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should slide the puck backwards to the goal while holding it with the gripper.
