The steps the robot should perform to grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location are:

1. Put the gripper above the cube.
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should put the gripper above the cube.
2. Grab the cube with the gripper.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the cube, the robot should grab the cube.
3. Move the gripper sideways towards the target location while holding the cube.
    - If the target location is to the right of the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the right while holding the cube.
    - If the target location is to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should move the gripper to the left while holding the cube.
4. Release the cube at the target location.
    - When the robot's gripper is at the target location, the robot should release the cube.
