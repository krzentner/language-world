Here are the steps the robot should perform for the `coffee-push` task:
Steps: 1. Put gripper above the mug handle
2. Drop gripper around the mug handle
3. Close gripper around the mug handle
4. Lift up the mug
5. Move gripper to the target location
6. Lower the mug on the target location
7. Open the gripper to release the mug

First, put the gripper roughly above the mug handle to avoid hitting the mug while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug handle, the robot should place the gripper above the mug handle.
Next, move the gripper around the mug handle and close the gripper to firmly grab the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug handle and open, the robot should drop gripper around the mug handle and close the gripper.
Now that the robot has a firm hold of the mug, lift it up to move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug handle, the robot should lift the mug up.
Move the gripper and the mug to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should move to the target location while holding the mug.
Once the robot has reached the target location, lower the mug onto it.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should lower the mug onto it.
Finally, open the gripper to release the mug.
- When the mug is successfully placed on the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the mug.
