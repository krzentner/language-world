To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Place the gripper near the wrench and the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the wrench and the peg, the robot should move the gripper to the area.
2. Position the gripper to grab the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is not positioned to grab the wrench, the robot should align the gripper correctly.
3. Close the gripper around the wrench to pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is open and around the wrench, the robot should close the gripper.
4. Move the gripper towards the peg and position it to insert the wrench around the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the peg or the wrench is not aligned with the peg, the robot should move and align the gripper.
5. Slide the wrench around the peg until it clicks in place.
- When the wrench is not around the peg or the gripper is not holding the wrench securely, the robot should slide the wrench until it clicks in place around the peg.
