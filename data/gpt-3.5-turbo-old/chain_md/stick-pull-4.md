To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

Steps:  1. Put the gripper near the thermos 2. Grab the stick with the gripper 3. Position the stick to pull the thermos 4. Pull the thermos to the target location

First, put the gripper near the thermos.
- When the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, the robot should place the gripper near the thermos.

Once the gripper is near the thermos, grab the stick with the gripper.
- When the stick is near the gripper and the gripper is open, the robot should pick up the stick with the gripper.

Position the stick to pull the thermos towards the target location. The robot should make sure that the stick is wedged underneath the thermos before pulling.
- When the stick is in position to wedge under the thermos, the robot should wedge the stick under the thermos.

Pull the thermos towards the target location by moving the gripper in the direction of the target location while holding the stick in place.
- When the robot's gripper holding the stick is in the direction of the target location, the robot should slowly pull the thermos towards the target location while holding the stick in place.
