To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Put the gripper roughly above the puck, so that we don't bump it while trying to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.

2. Move the gripper down around the puck to grab it.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.

3. Close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.

4. Move the puck to the target location.
- When the gripper is above the target location with the puck held in it, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
