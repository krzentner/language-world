Here is the program to perform the task, `plate-slide-back-side`:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Slide the plate back to the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
    # If the plate is below the gripper and not on the left, move left.
    if check("the plate is not left of the robot's gripper and the plate is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move_gripper("left of the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the gripper is on the left of the plate and the plate is not at the target location,
    # slide the plate back to the target location.
    if check("the robot's gripper is around the plate and the plate is not horizontally aligned with the robot"):
        robot.move_gripper("horizontally aligned with the target location")
```

This program begins by aligning the gripper with the plate, then grabbing the plate and sliding it sideways towards the target location. It assumes that the robot is able to detect the position of the plate and the target location.
