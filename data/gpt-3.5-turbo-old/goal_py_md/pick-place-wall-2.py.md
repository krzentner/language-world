#  2. If the gripper is not aligned with the puck, move to a position above the puck

#  4. If the gripper is below the wall, move the gripper to a position above the wall
#  5. Close the gripper around the puck
#  6. Move the gripper to the target location below the wall
#  7. Open the gripper to place the puck at the target location
