Here is the program to perform the `plate-slide-back-side` task:

```
# plate-slide-back-side: slide the plate back sideways into the target location
# def plate_slide_back_side(robot):
    # Steps:
    #  1. Put gripper above the plate
    #  2. Grab the plate with the gripper
    #  3. Slide the plate back sideways into the target location
    # First, put the gripper above the plate.
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate"):
        robot.move_gripper("vertically aligned with the plate")
    # If the plate is not yet gripped, move the gripper down and close the gripper
    if check("the plate is not gripped"):
        robot.move_gripper("above the plate", close_gripper=True)
    # If the plate is gripped, slide it back to the target location
    if check("the plate is gripped and robot's gripper is not near the target"):
        robot.move_gripper("near the target location")
```

This program assumes that the robot is already at the initial location of the plate, and that the target location is to the side and slightly back of the initial location. It also assumes that the gripper is parallel to the surface that the plate is sitting on. If any of these assumptions are not true, the program may need to be modified accordingly.
