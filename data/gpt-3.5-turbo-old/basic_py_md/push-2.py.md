Here's an example program that performs the `push` task using the provided code:

```
# push: slide the puck to the target location
def push(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```

To use this program, you would need to provide a `robot` object that has methods for `reach`, `put`, `push`, `slide`, and other tasks. You would then call the `push` function on the `robot` object to execute the `push` task.
