```
# push-wall: slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way
# def push_wall(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot has encountered a wall"):
        robot.turn("left")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
``` 

This should allow the robot to move left whenever it encounters a wall while pushing the puck towards the goal. However, keep in mind that the robot's movements and sensors may need to be customized based on the specifics of your robot's design and environment.
