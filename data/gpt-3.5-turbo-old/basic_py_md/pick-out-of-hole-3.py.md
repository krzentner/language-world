Sure, here's the code to perform the `pick-out-of-hole` task:

```
# pick-out-of-hole: pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location
# def pick_out_of_hole(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hole"):
        robot.move("gripper above the hole")
    if check("the robot's gripper is not around the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.drop("gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the peg and the robot's gripper is open"):
        robot.close("gripper around the peg")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the peg and the robot's gripper is closed"):
        robot.lift("the peg out of the hole")
        robot.reach("to goal")
``` 

This code ensures that the robot's gripper is above the hole containing the peg, and then grabs the peg using the gripper. After lifting the peg out of the hole, it moves the gripper to the target location.
