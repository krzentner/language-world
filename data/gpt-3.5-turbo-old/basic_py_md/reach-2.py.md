Here's the complete code for the `reach` task:

```
# reach: reach to the target location
def reach(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near reach target"):
        robot.move("gripper to reach target")
```

This code checks if the robot's gripper is not already near the reach target and moves the gripper to the target location if necessary. It assumes that the `robot` object has a `move` method that moves the gripper to a given location, and that the `check` function returns `True` if the given condition is met (in this case, if the gripper is not near the reach target). Note that the specific implementation of the `move` and `check` methods will depend on the specifics of the robot hardware and software being used.
