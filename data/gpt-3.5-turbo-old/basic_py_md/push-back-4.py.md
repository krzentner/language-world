Sure, here's the code to perform the `push-back` task:

```
# push-back: slide the puck backwards to the target location
# def push_back(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck"):
        robot.put("the gripper above the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near puck"):
        robot.push("the gripper into the puck")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper"):
        robot.move("the gripper back")
    if check("the robot's gripper is above the target location"):
        robot.slide("the puck to the goal")
```

The `push_back` function first checks if the robot's gripper is in the correct position to grab the puck. If it is, the robot moves the gripper back, away from the puck. Once the gripper is in the correct position above the target location, the robot slides the puck to the goal.
