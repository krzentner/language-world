# dial-turn: turn the dial
# def dial_turn(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not near the dial"):
        robot.move("gripper to dial")
    if check("the robot's gripper is near the dial and the gripper is not positioned around it"):
        robot.grab("the dial")
    if check("the gripper is positioned around the dial and the robot is not turning it"):
        robot.twist("the dial to the desired position")
    if check("the dial is at the desired position"):
        robot.release("the dial") 

Note: the `check()` function in this code is referring to a hypothetical helper function that checks if a certain condition is true, like if the robot's gripper is in the correct position to perform the next action. The actual implementation of `check()` is not shown here. The robot's `move()`, `grab()`, `twist()`, and `release()` functions are also hypothetical and would need to be implemented based on the specifics of the robot being used.
