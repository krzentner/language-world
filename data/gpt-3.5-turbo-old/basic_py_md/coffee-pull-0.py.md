# coffee-pull: grab the mug and pull it to the target location
# def coffee_pull(robot):
    if check("the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the mug handle and the robot's gripper is not close to the mug handle"):
        robot.move("gripper above the mug handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is close to the mug handle"):
        robot.grab("the mug handle")
    if check("the robot's gripper is holding the mug and the mug is not at the target location"):
        robot.pull("the mug to the target location")
    if check("the mug is at the target location"):

This program should provide a basic structure for pulling a coffee mug to a target location using the robot's gripper. You can modify and customize the specific instructions based on the specifics of the robot and the task at hand.
