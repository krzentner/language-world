To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the dial, the robot should move the gripper above the dial.
- When the gripper is aligned with the dial, the robot should close the gripper around the dial.
- When the gripper has a firm grip on the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the correct direction to unlock the door.
- When the dial has been turned to the correct position, the robot should release its grip on the dial.
