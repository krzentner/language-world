To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should pick up the ball.
    - When the robot is near the hoop and the ball is inside the gripper, the robot should aim for the hoop and throw the ball into the hoop.
    - If the ball misses the hoop, the robot should retrieve the ball and repeat the process until successful.
