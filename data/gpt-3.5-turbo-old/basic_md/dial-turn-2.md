To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the dial, the robot should move the gripper towards the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial and not around the dial, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the dial, the robot should turn the gripper in the desired direction to turn the dial to the desired position.
- When the desired position is reached, the robot should close the gripper to hold the dial in place.
