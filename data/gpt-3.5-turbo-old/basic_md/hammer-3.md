To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the hammer is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should pick it up.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the nail, the robot should position the gripper above the nail.
- When the hammer is above the nail, the robot should align the hammer to hit the nail.
- When the hammer is aligned and the gripper is closed, the robot should hit the nail with the hammer.
