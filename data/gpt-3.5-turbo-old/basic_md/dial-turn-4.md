To turn the dial reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is near the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
- When the robot is holding the dial, it should turn the dial to the desired position.
- When the dial is at the desired position, the robot should release the dial.
