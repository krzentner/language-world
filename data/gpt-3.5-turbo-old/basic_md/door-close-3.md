I'm sorry, but there are several details that are missing from the task `door-close`. To provide you with reliable steps, I need to know more information about the door and the environment where the robot will operate. For instance, I need to know if the door swings or slides, and if there are any obstacles in the way that might obstruct the robot's movements. Please provide me with more details so that I can assist you better.
