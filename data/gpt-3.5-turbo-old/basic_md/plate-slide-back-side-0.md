To slide the plate back sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not aligned with the target location, the robot should move the gripper above the plate and align the plate with the target location.
  - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the plate is not within the gripper range, the robot should move the gripper closer to the plate.
  - When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the plate.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the plate, the robot should slide the plate back sideways to the target location.
  - Once the plate is in the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the plate.
