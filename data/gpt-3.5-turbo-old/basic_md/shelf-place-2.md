To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is above the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower the gripper and close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the block and the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the block by opening the gripper and placing the block at the target location.
