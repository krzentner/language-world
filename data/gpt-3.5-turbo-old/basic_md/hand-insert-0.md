To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck, the robot should lift the puck off the surface.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed, the robot should lower the puck down to the target location and release it from the gripper.
