To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever, the robot should put gripper above the lever.
   - When the robot's gripper is above the lever and the robot's gripper is not around the lever, the robot should open the gripper.
   - When the robot's gripper is around the lever and the lever is not already pulled up, the robot should rotate the gripper up to pull the lever.
