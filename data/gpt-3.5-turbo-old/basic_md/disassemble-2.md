To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
- When the gripper is above the wrench, the robot should grab the wrench.
- When the gripper has a tight grasp on the wrench, the robot should pull the wrench off the peg.
- When the wrench is free from the peg, the robot should release the wrench.
