- When the robot's grip is holding the peg, the robot should move the gripper towards the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is near the wrench, the robot should open gripper to release the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, the robot should close the gripper and pick up the wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the wrench, the robot should move the gripper towards the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is near the peg, the robot should slide the wrench around the peg.
