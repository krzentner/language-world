To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the hammer, the robot should put gripper above the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the hammer and the hammer is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the hammer.
    - When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, the robot should place the hammer above the nail.
    - When the hammer is above the nail, the robot should swing the hammer down onto the nail.
    - When the hammer has hit the nail, the robot should release the hammer.
