To push the button from the front reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not touching the button, the robot should move the gripper towards the button.
- When the robot's gripper is touching the button, the robot should apply pressure to push the button.
