To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the mug, the robot should grab the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the mug and not above the target location, the robot should move towards the target location while holding the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and still holding the mug, the robot should release the mug at the target location.
