To pull up the handle reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is below the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the handle, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot has a firm grip on the handle, the robot should pull the handle upwards.
