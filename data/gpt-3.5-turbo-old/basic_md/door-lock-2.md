To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the door's dial, the robot should position the gripper above the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the dial is not gripped by the gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the dial.
- When the gripper has a firm hold on the dial, the robot should turn the dial to the correct position to lock/unlock the door.
- When the dial has been turned to the correct position, the robot should release the dial by opening the gripper.
