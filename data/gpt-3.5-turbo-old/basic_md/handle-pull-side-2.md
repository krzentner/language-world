To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the robot's gripper is not around the handle, the robot should put gripper around handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle and the handle is facing to the side, the robot should pull the handle up while moving the gripper to the side.
