To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube and the robot is above the target bin, the robot should release the cube into the bin. 

It's important to first make sure the robot's gripper is above the cube before attempting to pick it up. Once the gripper is positioned correctly, the robot should check if the gripper is open and if it is not aligned with the cube, drop the gripper around the cube. From there, the robot can close the gripper around the cube, making sure to verify that it is holding the cube securely. Finally, the robot can move the gripper above the target bin and release the cube into the bin.
