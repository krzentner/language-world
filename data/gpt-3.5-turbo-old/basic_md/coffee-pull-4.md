To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the center of the mug, the robot should put the gripper above the center of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the center of the mug and the robot's gripper is not around the mug, the robot should drop the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle of the mug and the mug is below the robot's gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the handle of the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the mug is in front of the robot's gripper, the robot should pull the mug to the target location.
- When the mug reaches the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the mug.
