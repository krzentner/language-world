To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not around the lever and the robot's gripper is near the lever, the robot should open the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is around the lever and the robot's gripper is not above the lever, the robot should lift the gripper above the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is above the lever, the robot should pull the lever up.
