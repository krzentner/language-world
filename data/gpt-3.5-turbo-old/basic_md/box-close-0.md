To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should move the gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the lid and the robot's gripper is not above the box, the robot should move the lid above the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should open the gripper and release the lid onto the box.
