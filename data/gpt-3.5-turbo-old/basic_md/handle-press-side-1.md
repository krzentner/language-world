To push down the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put gripper above the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the handle and the handle is not left of the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is in front of the handle and the handle is not almost vertical, the robot should rotate the handle downwards.
- When the handle is almost vertical, the robot should push down on the handle.
