To slide the plate into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the plate and the plate is not in front of the robot, the robot should move the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not in front of the robot, the robot should move the plate in front of the gripper.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the plate and the plate is near the target location, the robot should slide the plate towards the target location.
- When the plate reaches the target location, the robot should stop sliding and release the plate by opening the gripper.
