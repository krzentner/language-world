To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
    - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is above the dial and the robot's gripper is not around the dial, the robot should grab the dial.
    - When the robot's gripper is around the dial and the dial is not in the correct position, the robot should turn the dial to the desired position.
    - When the dial is in the correct position, the robot should release the dial.
