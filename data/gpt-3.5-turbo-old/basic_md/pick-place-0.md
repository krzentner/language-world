To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above the puck.
2. When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
3. When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the puck.
4. When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should move the arm to the target location.
5. When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should open the gripper to release the puck at the target location.
