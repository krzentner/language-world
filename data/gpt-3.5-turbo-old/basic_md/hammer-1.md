To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the nail, the robot should position itself above the nail.
- When the hammer is not in the robot's gripper, the robot should pick up the hammer.
- When the hammer is in the robot's gripper, the robot should position the hammer above the nail.
- When the hammer is above the nail and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should swing the hammer down onto the nail.
- When the robot's gripper is open and the hammer is above the nail, the robot should drop the hammer.
