To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is open and not around the cube, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- The robot should lift the cube without hitting the bin or other obstacles.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the gripper is closed, the robot should release the cube into the bin.
- The robot should ensure that the cube is placed properly in the bin without damaging the cube or the bin.
