To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
  - When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above cube.
  - When the robot's gripper is around cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around cube.
  - When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move it towards the target bin.
  - When the robot's gripper is above the target bin and the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should release the cube inside the bin.
