To put the ball into the hoop reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the ball, the robot should move the gripper above the ball.
- When the robot's gripper is above the ball and the ball is not inside the gripper, the robot should close the gripper around the ball.
- When the ball is inside the gripper and the robot's gripper is not above the hoop, the robot should move the gripper above the hoop.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hoop and the ball is inside the gripper, the robot should throw the ball into the hoop.
