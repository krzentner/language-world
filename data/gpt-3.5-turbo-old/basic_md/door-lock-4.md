To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial, the robot should put gripper above the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the dial and the dial is not turned to the correct position, the robot should turn the dial to the correct position.
- When the dial is turned to the correct position, the robot should push down on the dial to lock the door.
