To put the wrench around the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
 - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
 - When the robot's gripper is above the peg and the wrench is near the peg, the robot should position the gripper so that it surrounds the wrench and peg.
 - When the gripper surrounds the wrench and peg, the robot should close the gripper to hold the wrench in place.
 - When the gripper is holding the wrench and peg, the robot should move the gripper and the wrench to the desired location.
