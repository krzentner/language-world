To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the peg is not horizontally aligned with the robot's gripper and the peg is not to the left of the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the robot's gripper is horizontally aligned with the peg and the peg is not directly above the hole, the robot should move the peg upward.
- When the peg is directly above the hole, the robot should pull the peg out from the hole.
