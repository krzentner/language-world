To use the stick to pull the thermos to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the stick or the thermos, the robot should move to the area where the stick and the thermos are located.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the stick and the stick is not in a stable position, the robot should stabilize the stick.
- When the robot's gripper is around the stick and the robot's gripper is not near the thermos, the robot should move the stick to the thermos and align it to hook onto the thermos handle.
- When the stick is hooked onto the thermos handle and the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should pull the stick and the thermos to the target location.
- When the thermos is at the target location, the robot should release the stick and the thermos should be in the desired position at the target location.
