To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near reach target, the robot should first move to a position where it can see the target location and the short wall.
- The robot should then move its gripper to a position above the short wall, without touching the wall.
- From this position, the robot should reach towards the target location and move its gripper to the target location.
