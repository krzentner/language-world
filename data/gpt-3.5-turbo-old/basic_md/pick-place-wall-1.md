To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around puck.
- When the robot's gripper is above the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should lift the puck vertically.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should lower the gripper down to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should release the puck and open gripper.
