To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place gripper above puck.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should pick up the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the puck, the robot should move its arm to reach the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should place the puck at the target location by opening the gripper.
