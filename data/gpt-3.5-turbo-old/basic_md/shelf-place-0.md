To pick up the block and place it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the block, the robot should place the gripper above the block.
- When the robot's gripper is around the block and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the block.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the block, the robot should lift the block.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the target location, the robot should move to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location and the robot's gripper is closed, the robot should place the block at the target location by opening the gripper.
