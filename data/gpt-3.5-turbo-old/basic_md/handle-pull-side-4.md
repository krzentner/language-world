To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, put gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, move gripper to the side of the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the handle, pull up on the handle.
