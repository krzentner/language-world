To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move gripper towards the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is near the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is securely gripping the handle, the robot should push the drawer closed.
