To push the button from the front with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the button and the robot's gripper is not obstructed by the wall, the robot should move towards the button.
- When the robot's gripper is obstructed by the wall, the robot should move to the side of the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the button and the robot's gripper is not gripping anything, the robot should drop the gripper onto the button.
- When the robot's gripper is pressing down on the button, the robot should release the button and move away from the button to complete the task.
