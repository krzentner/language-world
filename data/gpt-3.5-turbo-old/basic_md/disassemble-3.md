To pull the wrench off the peg reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the wrench, the robot should put gripper above wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the wrench and the robot's gripper is not around the wrench, the robot should put gripper around wrench.
- When the robot's gripper is around the wrench, the robot should pull up on the wrench to remove it from the peg.
