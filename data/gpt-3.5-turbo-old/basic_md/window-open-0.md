To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- If the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and the robot's gripper is below the window handle, it should move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
- If the robot's gripper is near the window handle, it should slide the window to the left.
- If the robot's gripper is in front of the window handle, it should push the window to the left harder.
