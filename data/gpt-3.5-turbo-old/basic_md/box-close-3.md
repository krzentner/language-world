To pick up the box lid and place it on the box reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the box lid, the robot should move the gripper above the lid.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box lid and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the lid.
- When the lid is firmly gripped, the robot should lift the lid off the box.
- When the robot's gripper is not above the box, the robot should move the gripper above the opening of the box.
- When the robot's gripper is above the box opening and the gripper is open, the robot should place the lid onto the box.
- When the lid is properly positioned on the box, the robot should release its grip and open the gripper.
