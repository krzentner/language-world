To hit the nail with the hammer reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the hammer, the robot should put the gripper above the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is above the hammer and the robot's gripper is not holding the hammer, the robot should grab the hammer.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the hammer and the hammer is not above the nail, the robot should move the gripper and hammer above the nail.
- When the robot's gripper and hammer are above the nail, the robot should lower the hammer onto the nail.
- When the hammer hits the nail, the robot should lift the hammer and repeat the lowering action until the nail has been fully driven in.
