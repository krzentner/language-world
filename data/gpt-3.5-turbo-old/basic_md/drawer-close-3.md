To push the drawer close reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near the drawer handle, the robot should move the gripper to the drawer handle.
- When the gripper is aligned with the drawer handle and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the drawer handle.
- When the gripper is holding the drawer handle, the robot should push the drawer closed.
