To push the button on the coffee machine reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button.
   - The robot should hold the button down for the appropriate time to make coffee.
