To rotate the lever up reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the lever handle, the robot should put the gripper above the lever.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the lever handle, the robot should grab the lever handle.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the lever handle, the robot should rotate the lever up.
