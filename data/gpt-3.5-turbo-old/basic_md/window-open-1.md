To slide the window open to the left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. If the gripper is not vertically aligned with the window handle and is below the window handle, then move the gripper to the right of the window handle.
2. When the gripper is near the window handle, slide the window to the left.
3. If the gripper is in front of the window handle, push the window left harder.
