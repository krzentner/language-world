To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the gripper is closed, the robot should lift the cube off the ground.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move sideways towards the target location.
- When the robot reaches the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
