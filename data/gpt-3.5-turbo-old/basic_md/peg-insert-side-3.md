To insert the peg into the hole from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put gripper above peg.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and the peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab peg.
- When the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg and the peg is not horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should align peg to hole.
- When the peg is horizontally aligned with hole, the robot should insert peg into hole.
