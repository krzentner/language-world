To push the button down from above reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should put the gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should descend the gripper onto the button and apply pressure until the button is pressed down.
