To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the robot's gripper is open, it should close gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper to the target location while making sure the cube stays gripped.
- When the robot's gripper is over the target location, the robot should release the cube.
