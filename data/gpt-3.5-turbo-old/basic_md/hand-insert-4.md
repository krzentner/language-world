To pick up the puck and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the puck, the robot should place the gripper above the puck
- When the robot's gripper is not around the puck and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the puck.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should lift the puck.
- When the robot is holding the puck, the robot should move towards the target location.
- When the robot is close to the target location and the gripper is closed, the robot should place the puck at the target location.
