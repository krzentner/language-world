To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- Initially, the robot should check if the gripper is above the puck or not. If not, it should put gripper above the puck.
- If the wall is between the robot and the puck and the gripper is not in line with the puck, the robot should first move the gripper to the left or right of the wall and then align with the puck.
- If the wall is between the robot and the puck and the gripper is in line with the puck, the robot should first move the gripper to the other side of the wall and then align with the puck again.
- Once the gripper is in line with the puck on the same side of the wall, the robot should push the gripper into the puck to pick it up.
- After picking up the puck, the robot should check if the wall is between the robot and the goal. If yes, it should move the gripper to the other side of the wall and then move the puck to the target location.
- Finally, the robot should release the puck at the target location.
