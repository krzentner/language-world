To pick up the peg out of the hole and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the hole, the robot should move the gripper above the hole.
- When the gripper is vertically aligned with the peg and the gripper is not around the peg, the robot should drop the gripper around the peg.
- When the gripper is around the peg and the peg is not above the target location, the robot should lift the peg out of the hole and move it above the target location.
- When the gripper is above the target location and the gripper is closed, the robot should release the peg at the target location.
