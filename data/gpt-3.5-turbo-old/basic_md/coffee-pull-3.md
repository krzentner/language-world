To grab the mug and pull it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is near the mug and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is holding on to the mug, the robot should pull the mug towards the target location.
- When the mug is at the target location, the robot should release the gripper to let go of the mug.
