To grab the mug and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps for the `coffee-push` task:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the mug, the robot should place the gripper above the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the mug.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the mug, the robot should lift the mug and move it to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target location, the robot should open the gripper and release the mug. 

It is important to ensure that the gripper holds the mug with enough pressure to prevent the mug from slipping while lifting or moving it, but not too much pressure that it could damage the mug. Also, the robot should make sure to move the mug slowly and steadily to avoid any spills or accidents.
