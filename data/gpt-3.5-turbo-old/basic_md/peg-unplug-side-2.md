To pull the peg out from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the peg, the robot should put the gripper above the peg.
- When the peg is not left of the robot's gripper and peg is not forward aligned with the robot's gripper, the robot should grab the peg.
- When the peg is grabbed and the robot's gripper is forward aligned with the peg, the robot should pull the peg out of the hole.
