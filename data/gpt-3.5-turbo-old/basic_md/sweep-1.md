To grab the cube and move it sideways to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should move the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is closed around the cube, the robot should lift the cube off the surface.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move to the left or right while gripping the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the target location, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
