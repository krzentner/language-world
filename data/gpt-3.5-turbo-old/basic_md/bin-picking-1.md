To pick up the cube and place it in the target bin reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is above the cube and the robot's gripper is open, the robot should lower gripper to the cube and close the gripper around it.
- When the robot's gripper has the cube and is near the target bin, the robot should align the gripper above the target bin.
- When the robot's gripper is above the target bin, the robot should release the cube into it.
