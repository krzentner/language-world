To turn the faucet left reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not near the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the faucet handle, the robot should move gripper to the right of the faucet handle and position it vertically.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the faucet handle and the robot's gripper is not around the faucet handle, the robot should close gripper around the faucet handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the faucet handle, the robot should turn the handle left until it is fully open.
- When the handle is fully open, the robot should release the gripper and move away.
