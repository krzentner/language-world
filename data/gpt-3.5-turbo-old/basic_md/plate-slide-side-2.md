To slide the plate sideways into the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the plate, the robot should place the gripper above the plate.
- When the robot's gripper is above the plate and the plate is not between the gripper and the target location, the robot should move the gripper to the side of the plate closest to the target location.
- When the robot's gripper is near the plate and the plate is between the gripper and the target location, the robot should push the plate sideways toward the target location.
- When the plate has been pushed to the target location, the robot should release the grip on the plate.
