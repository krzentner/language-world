To pick up the puck and hold it at the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

1. Check if the gripper is not above the puck
2. If the gripper is not above the puck, move the gripper above the puck
3. Check if the gripper is not around the puck and is open
4. If the gripper is not around the puck and is open, drop the gripper around the puck
5. Check if the gripper is near the puck and is open
6. If the gripper is near the puck and is open, close the gripper around the puck
7. Check if the gripper is above the puck and is closed
8. If the gripper is above the puck and is closed, move the gripper to the target location and release the puck.
