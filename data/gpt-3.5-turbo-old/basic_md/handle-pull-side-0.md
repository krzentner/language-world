To pull up the handle from the side reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the handle, the robot should put the gripper above the handle.
- When the handle is not to the left of the robot's gripper and the robot's gripper is not already holding the handle, the robot should grab the handle.
- When the robot's gripper is positioned to the side of the handle, the robot should pull up on the handle.
