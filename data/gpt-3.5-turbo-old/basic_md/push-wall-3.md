To slide the puck to the target location with a small wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
   - When the robot's gripper is not above puck and the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the puck, the robot should put the gripper above the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the puck and the robot's gripper is not near the puck, the robot should push the gripper into the puck.
   - When the robot's gripper is near the puck and the puck is below the robot's gripper, the robot should approach the wall as close as possible.
   - When the robot's gripper is against the wall, the robot should start sliding the puck towards the goal while keeping the gripper pressed against the wall to prevent the puck from deviating from its trajectory.
   - When the robot's gripper reaches the target location, it should release the puck.
