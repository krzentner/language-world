To turn the dial on the door reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the dial and the robot's gripper is not close to the dial, the robot should move the gripper close to the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is close to the dial and not vertically aligned with it, the robot should align the gripper with the dial.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the dial, the robot should turn the dial in the correct direction until it reaches the desired combination.
