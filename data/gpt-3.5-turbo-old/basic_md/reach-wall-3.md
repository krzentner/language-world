To reach to the target location with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not near reach target and there is a short wall in the way, the robot should try to reach above the wall.
- If the robot's gripper cannot reach above the wall, the robot should move to a different location to try to reach the target from a different angle or position.
- Once the robot's gripper is above the wall, the robot should then reach to the goal normally.
