To turn the faucet right reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:
- When the robot's gripper is not aligned with the faucet knob, the robot should align the gripper with the knob.
- When the robot's gripper is aligned with the knob and the knob is turned counterclockwise, the robot should turn the knob clockwise until it stops.
