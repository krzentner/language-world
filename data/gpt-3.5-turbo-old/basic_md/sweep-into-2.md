To grab the cube and move it to the target location reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not above the cube, the robot should place the gripper above the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is not around the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should drop the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is near the cube and the gripper is open, the robot should close the gripper around the cube.
- When the robot's gripper is holding the cube, the robot should move the gripper towards the target location while keeping the cube close to the ground.
- When the gripper is above the target location and the gripper is holding the cube, the robot should release the cube by opening the gripper.
