To pull the drawer open reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the drawer handle, the robot should put the gripper above the drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the drawer handle and the robot's gripper is not around the drawer handle, the robot should put the gripper around the drawer handle.
- When the robot's gripper is around the drawer handle, the robot should pull away from the drawer.
