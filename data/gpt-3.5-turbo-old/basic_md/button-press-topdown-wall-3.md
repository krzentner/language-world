To push the button down from above with a short wall in the way reliably, the robot should perform the following steps:

- When the robot's gripper is not vertically aligned with the button and not above the wall, the robot should move gripper above the wall.
- When the robot's gripper is above the wall and not vertically aligned with the button, the robot should move gripper above the button.
- When the robot's gripper is vertically aligned with the button, the robot should push down on the button with enough force to overcome the height of the wall.
