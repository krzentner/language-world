There was a jar on the counter.
I turned to face the jar.
I grabbed the lid of the jar.
I turned the lid to the left.
I lifted the lid off of the jar.
I put the lid on the counter.
I put my hand in the jar.
I grabbed something from the jar.
I put the lid back on the jar.
I turned the lid to the right.
I let go.
Done.
