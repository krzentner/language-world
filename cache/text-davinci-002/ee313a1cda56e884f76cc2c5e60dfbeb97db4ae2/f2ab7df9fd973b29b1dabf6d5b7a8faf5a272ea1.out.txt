There was a jar on the counter.
I turned to face the counter.
I reached out with my hand.
I grabbed the lid of the jar.
I turned the lid to the left.
I heard a pop.
I removed the lid.
I put my hand in the jar.
I grabbed something from the jar.
I pulled my hand out of the jar.
I closed the jar.
I put the lid back on the jar.
I turned the lid to the right.
I let go.
Done.
